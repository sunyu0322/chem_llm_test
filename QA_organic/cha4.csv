"problem In the (notional and best avoided in practice) formation of \( \mathrm{{NaCl}} \) from a sodium atom and a chlorine atom, descriptions like this abound in textbooks: 'an electron is transferred from the valency shell of the sodium atom to the valency shell of the chlorine atom'. What is meant, in quantum number terms, by 'valency shell'? Give a complete description in terms of all four quantum numbers of that transferred electron: (a) while it is in the sodium atom and (b) after it has been transferred to the chlorine atom. Why is the formation of \( \mathrm{{NaCl}} \) by this process to be discouraged?<!-- Media --><!-- figureText: 2. \( {\mathrm{H}}^{ + },{\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O} \) -->CCC(=O)CCC(=O)OCCCCC(C)(C1=CC=CC=C1)O.CCCC(=O)OOCC(C)(C)C(CCCOC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1)[R10].CC(C)C(CCCOC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1)(O)[R].CCCCC1(CCCCC1)O.CCCCC1(CCCCC1)O.CC1=CC=CC(=C1)C(CC=C)(O)[R].C(=C\OOC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1)/CCl.C(=C\OOC=O)/CCl","suggested solution Sodium and chlorine are at either end of the second row of the periodic table: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) ,Ar. Sodium is in group 1 and has the configuration \( 1{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2},2{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2},2{\mathrm{p}}^{6},3{\mathrm{\;s}}^{1} \) . Chlorine is in group VII (17) and has the configuration \( 1{s}^{2},2{s}^{2},2{p}^{6},3{s}^{2},3{p}^{5} \) . The ’valency shell’ refers to the outer shell of the atom where all the chemistry occurs and is known by the value of the principal quantum number(n)for that shell. This is the number at the front of the electronic description: in this case ( \( \mathrm{{Na}} \) or \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) ) the electrons are in \( 3\mathrm{\;s} \) or \( 3\mathrm{p} \) orbitals so \( n = 3 \) . While the electron is on the sodium atom it is a \( 3\mathrm{\;s} \) electron,that is, \( n = 3;l = 0 \) . There is only one type of s orbital so \( {m}_{l} \) must also be 0 . The spin is arbitrarily up or down so it doesn’t matter whether you say \( {m}_{s} =  - \frac{1}{2} \) or \( + \frac{1}{2} \) . When the electron is transferred to the chlorine atom it goes into a \( 3{\mathrm{p}}_{z} \) orbital so we have \( n = 3 \) again but now \( l = 1 \) (p orbital), \( {m}_{l} \) is \( 1\left( {\mathrm{p}}_{z}\right. \) orbital),and again \( {m}_{s} =  - \frac{1}{2} \) or \( + \frac{1}{2} \) . This method of making sodium chloride is to be discouraged because both elements are extremely reactive and would combine with an enormous release of energy."
"problem What is the electronic structure of these species?

Potassium is below sodium in the periodic table so this cation has lost its 4s electron and is: \( 1{s}^{2},2{s}^{2},2{p}^{6},3{s}^{2},3{p}^{6} \) . Xe Xenon is a noble gas in group VIII (18).

The \( 2\mathrm{p} \) orbitals are much closer in energy to the \( 1\mathrm{\;s} \) orbital than the \( 3\mathrm{p} \) orbitals, resulting in greater energy gain on \( \sigma \) bond formation. Bonds between \( \mathrm{H} \) and \( \mathrm{C},\mathrm{N},\mathrm{O} \) ,and \( \mathrm{F} \) are stronger due to \( 2\mathrm{{pAOs}} \) being used, while \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{4},{\mathrm{{NH}}}_{3} \) ,and \( {\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O} \) are hybridized, enhancing orbital overlap."
