"In the (notional and best avoided in practice) formation of \( \mathrm{{NaCl}} \) from a sodium atom and a chlorine atom, descriptions like this abound in textbooks: 'an electron is transferred from the valency shell of the sodium atom to the valency shell of the chlorine atom'. What is meant, in quantum number terms, by 'valency shell'? Give a complete description in terms of all four quantum numbers of that transferred electron: (a) while it is in the sodium atom and (b) after it has been transferred to the chlorine atom. Why is the formation of \( \mathrm{{NaCl}} \) by this process to be discouraged?","Sodium's configuration is \( 1{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2},2{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2},2{\mathrm{p}}^{6},3{\mathrm{\;s}}^{1} \), and chlorine's is \( 1{s}^{2},2{s}^{2},2{p}^{6},3{s}^{2},3{p}^{5} \). The 'valency shell' refers to the outer shell where chemistry occurs. For sodium, the electron is in the \( 3\mathrm{\;s} \) orbital (\( n = 3;l = 0; m_l = 0; m_s = +\frac{1}{2} \) or \( -\frac{1}{2} \)). After transfer to chlorine, it occupies a \( 3{\mathrm{p}}_{z} \) orbital (\( n = 3;l = 1; m_l = 1; m_s = +\frac{1}{2} \) or \( -\frac{1}{2} \)). This process is discouraged because both elements are highly reactive, leading to an explosive release of energy."
"What is the electronic structure of these species? You should consult a periodic table before answering. \[\text{HO HS}{}^{ \ominus  }\;\text{HS}{}^{ \oplus  }\;\text{Xe}\]","\( {\mathrm{H}}^{ - } \): \( 1{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2} \); \( {\mathrm{{HS}}}^{ - } \): \( 1{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2},2{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2},2{\mathrm{p}}^{6},3{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2},3{\mathrm{p}}^{6} \); Potassium cation: \( 1{s}^{2},2{s}^{2},2{p}^{6},3{s}^{2},3{p}^{6} \); Xe: \( 1{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2},2{s}^{2},2{p}^{6},3{s}^{2},3{p}^{6},4{s}^{2},3{d}^{10},4{p}^{6},5{s}^{2},4{d}^{10},5{p}^{6} \)."
"What sort of bonds can be formed between \( s \) orbitals and \( p \) orbitals? Which will provide better overlap, \( 1\mathrm{\;s} + 2\mathrm{p} \) or \( 1\mathrm{\;s} + 3\mathrm{p} \)? Which bonds will be stronger, those between hydrogen and \( \mathrm{C},\mathrm{N},\mathrm{O} \), and \( \mathrm{F} \) on the one hand or those between hydrogen and \( \mathrm{{Si}},\mathrm{P},\mathrm{S} \), and \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) on the other? Within the first group, bond strength goes in this order: \( \mathrm{{HF}} > \mathrm{{OH}} > \mathrm{{NH}} > \mathrm{{CH}} \). Why?","\( s \) and \( p \) orbitals form \( \sigma \) bonds. \( 1\mathrm{\;s} + 2\mathrm{p} \) overlaps better due to closer energy levels. Bonds with \( \mathrm{C},\mathrm{N},\mathrm{O},\mathrm{F} \) are stronger than with \( \mathrm{{Si}},\mathrm{P},\mathrm{S},\mathrm{{Cl}} \) because \( 2\mathrm{p} \) orbitals are used in the former and \( 3\mathrm{p} \) in the latter. Bond strength decreases as \( \mathrm{{HF}} > \mathrm{{OH}} > \mathrm{{NH}} > \mathrm{{CH}} \) due to increasing electronegativity lowering the energy gap between bonding orbitals."
"Though no helium ’molecule’ \( {\mathrm{{He}}}_{2} \) exists, an ion \( {\mathrm{{He}}}_{2}^{ + } \) does exist. Explain.","Helium atoms have full \( 1s \) orbitals, forming bonding (\( \sigma \)) and antibonding (\( {\sigma }^{ * }\)) orbitals when combined. In \( {\mathrm{{He}}}_{2} \), both orbitals would be filled, resulting in zero bond order. However, \( {\mathrm{{He}}}_{2}^{ + } \) has one fewer electron, leaving the antibonding orbital partially filled and creating a bond order of one-half, allowing its existence."
"You may be surprised to know that the molecule \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \), with divalent carbon, can exist. It is, of course, very unstable but it is known and it can have two different structures. One has an \( \mathrm{H} - \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{H} \) bond angle of 180 and the other an angle of 120 . Suggest structures for these species and say which orbitals will be occupied by all bonding and nonbonding electrons. Which structure is likely to be more stable?","The \( {180}^{ \circ  } \) structure involves sp hybridized carbon with two degenerate p orbitals each holding one electron. The \( {120}^{ \circ  } \) structure involves \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2} \) hybridized carbon with the remaining electrons in a lower-energy \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2} \) orbital. The \( {180}^{ \circ  } \) structure is likely more stable due to unpaired degenerate electrons being more stable than paired ones in different orbitals."
"Construct an MO diagram for the molecule LiH and suggest what type of bond it might have.","Lithium donates its \( 2\mathrm{\;s} \) electron to hydrogen’s \( 1\mathrm{\;s} \) orbital, resulting in an ionic compound with both achieving \( 1{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2} \) configuration. Lithium hydride is thus primarily ionic."
"Deduce the MOs for the oxygen molecule. What is the bond order in oxygen and where are the \( {2p} \) electrons?","Oxygen forms one \( \sigma \) bond and two \( \pi \) bonds, with two unpaired electrons in antibonding \( {\pi }^{ * } \) orbitals. The bond order is 2, and the unpaired electrons make oxygen reactive."
"Construct MOs for acetylene (ethyne) without hybridization.","Acetylene has a \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{C} \) triple bond using \( 2\mathrm{\;s} \) and \( 2{\mathrm{p}}_{x} \) orbitals for \( \sigma \) bonds, and \( 2{\mathrm{p}}_{y} \) and \( 2{\mathrm{p}}_{z} \) for \( \pi \) bonds. The three lowest orbitals are bonding, and the top two are degenerate \( \pi \) orbitals corresponding to the C-C \( \pi \) bonds."
"What is the shape and hybridization of each carbon atom in these molecules? `C1CC=C(CC1)C#N.CC(=CC(=O)C)C.C([2H])(=C=O)C`","Each carbon’s hybridization depends on \( \sigma \) bonds: sp (linear), \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2} \) (trigonal), \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{3} \) (tetrahedral). Specific configurations must be detailed based on the given structures."
"Suggest detailed structures for these molecules and predict their shapes. Don't use these sorts of drawings in your answer. \[{\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2},{\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} = {\mathrm{{NCH}}}_{3},{\mathrm{{CHF}}}_{3},{\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} = \mathrm{C} = {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2},{\left( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\right) }_{2}\mathrm{O}\]","Carbon dioxide is linear with sp hybridized carbon. Imine is planar with \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2} \) hybridized carbon and nitrogen. Trifluoromethane is tetrahedral with \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{3} \) carbon. Allene is linear at central carbon with orthogonal planes. Ethylene oxide forms a three-membered ring with planar \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{O} \) skeleton."
