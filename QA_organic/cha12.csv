"Problem 2\nDirect ester formation from alcohols \( \left( {{\mathrm{R}}^{1}\mathrm{{OH}}}\right) \) and carboxylic acids \( \left( {{\mathrm{R}}^{2}{\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H}}\right) \) works in acid solution but does not work at all in basic solution. Why not? By contrast, ester formation from alcohols \( \left( {{\mathrm{R}}^{1}\mathrm{{OH}}}\right) \) and carboxylic acid anhydrides, \( {\left( {\mathrm{R}}^{2}\mathrm{{CO}}\right) }_{2}\mathrm{O} \) ,or acid chlorides, \( \mathrm{{RCOCl}} \) ,is commonly carried out in the presence of amines such as pyridine or \( {\mathrm{{Et}}}_{3}\mathrm{\;N} \) . Why does this work?\nPurpose of the problem\nThis question may sound trivial but students starting organic chemistry often make the error of trying to form esters from carboxylic acids in basic solution. Thinking about the reasons may save you from the error.","Suggested solution\nThe reaction works in acid solution because the carboxylic acid gets protonated and becomes a good electrophile. Later, the intermediate gets protonated again so that a molecule of water can be lost.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C(=O)(O)[O-].C(=O)(O)[O-].C(=O)(O)[O-].C(=O)(O)[O-].C(=O)(O)[O-].C(=O)(O)[O-].C(=O)(O)[O-].C(=O)(O)[O-].[Al+3].[Al+3].[Al+3].[OH-].[OH-].[OH-].[OH-]`"

The amine is a better nucleophile than the alcohol and the cyclization occurs because it is an equilibrium with two equal leaving groups (both alcohols) but one (EtOH) goes away when it leaves while the other is attached and cannot escape. The second reaction is more straightforward. The product is used to control the stereochemistry of new molecules as you will see in Chapter 45. For the first time we are using shorthand mechanisms.
