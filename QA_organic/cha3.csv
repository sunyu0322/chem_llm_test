"Problem 1: How does the mass spectrum give evidence of isotopes in the compounds of bromine, chlorine, and carbon? Assuming the molecular ion of each of these compounds is of 100% abundance, what peaks (and in what intensity) would appear around that mass number? (a) \( {\mathrm{C}}_{5}{\mathrm{H}}_{5}\mathrm{{BrO}} \), (b) \( {\mathrm{C}}_{60} \), (c) \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{4}\mathrm{{BrCl}} \)? Give in cases (a) and (c) a possible structure for the compound. What compound is (b)?",Bromine has two isotopes (\( {}^{79}\mathrm{Br} \) and \( {}^{81}\mathrm{Br} \)), chlorine has two (\( {}^{35}\mathrm{Cl} \) and \( {}^{37}\mathrm{Cl} \)), and carbon has \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) (1.1%). For (a) \( {\mathrm{C}}_{5}{\mathrm{H}}_{5}\mathrm{BrO} \), peaks at 124/126 (1:1 ratio) with weak \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) peaks at 125/127. For (b) \( {\mathrm{C}}_{60} \) (buckminsterfullerene), a strong peak at 720 and \( \mathrm{M}+1 \) at 721 (66% intensity due to \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \)). For (c) \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{4}\mathrm{BrCl} \), four peaks: 190 (3), 192 (3+1), 194 (1) with ratios 3:4:1. SMILES: `C1=C(C=CC(=C1)Cl)Br`, `C1=CC(=CC(=C1)Cl)Br`."
"Problem 2: The \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR spectrum for ethyl benzoate contains these peaks: 17.3, 61.1, 100-150 ppm (four peaks), and 166.8 ppm. Which peak belongs to which carbon atom? SMILES: `CCOC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1`","Ethyl benzoate (`CCOC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1`) has four regions: 17.3 ppm (methyl), 61.1 ppm (methoxy), 100-150 ppm (aromatic), and 166.8 ppm (carbonyl). The four aromatic peaks correspond to substituted benzene carbons."
"Problem 3: The thinner used in typists’ correction fluids is \( {\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{3}{\mathrm{Cl}}_{3} \) with \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR peaks at 45.1 and 95.0 ppm. What is its structure? A commercial paint thinner has peaks at 7.0, 27.5, 35.2, 45.3, 95.6, and 206.3 ppm. Suggest its composition. SMILES: `C(C(Cl)Cl)Cl`, `CC(Cl)(Cl)Cl`","The correction fluid compound is 1,1,1-trichloroethane (`CC(Cl)(Cl)Cl`). The paint thinner contains 1,1,1-trichloroethane and butanone (`CCC(C)=O`), indicated by the carbonyl peak at 206.3 ppm."
"Problem 4: The ’normal’ O-H stretch (without hydrogen bonding) occurs at ~3600 cm⁻¹. Calculate the reduced mass \( \mu \) for O-H, O-D, and S-H. Why do O-D and S-H stretches both appear at ~2500 cm⁻¹?","For O-H: \( \mu = \frac{16 \cdot 1}{16 + 1} = 0.94 \). For O-D: \( \mu = \frac{16 \cdot 2}{16 + 2} = 1.78 \). For S-H: \( \mu = \frac{32 \cdot 1}{32 + 1} = 0.97 \). The lower frequency for O-D and S-H is due to reduced mass effects (O-D) and weaker S-H bond strength."
"Problem 5: Three \( {\mathrm{C}}_{3}{\mathrm{H}}_{5}\mathrm{NO} \) compounds have distinct IR spectra. Deduce their structures. SMILES: `C1C(=O)CN1`, `C1CNC1=O`, `C(C#N)CO`","(a) IR: 3000/1700 cm⁻¹ → lactam (`C1C(=O)CN1`). (b) IR: 3000/1600-1700 cm⁻¹ → unsaturated amide (`C1CNC1=O`). (c) IR: 3000/2200 cm⁻¹ → nitrile + alcohol (`C(C#N)CO`)."
"Problem 6: Four \( {\mathrm{C}}_{4}{\mathrm{H}}_{6}{\mathrm{O}}_{2} \) compounds have distinct IR/\( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR spectra. Determine their structures. SMILES: `C1C(=O)OC1`, `C#CCO`, `C1CCC(=O)C1`, `C=CC(=O)OC`","(a) IR 1745 cm⁻¹, NMR 214 ppm → cyclic ketone (`C1C(=O)OC1`). (b) IR 3300 cm⁻¹ → alkyne alcohol (`C#CCO`). (c) IR 1770 cm⁻¹ → cyclic anhydride (`C1CCC(=O)C1`). (d) IR 1720/1650 cm⁻¹ → unsaturated ester (`C=CC(=O)OC`)."
"Problem 7: Three \( {\mathrm{C}}_{4}{\mathrm{H}}_{8}\mathrm{O} \) compounds have distinct spectra. Deduce structures. SMILES: `CCCC(=O)O`, `C=CCCO`, `C1CCOC1`","(A) IR 1730 cm⁻¹, NMR 201.6 ppm → butanal (`CCCC(=O)O`). (B) IR 3200 cm⁻¹, NMR 134.7 ppm → crotyl alcohol (`C=CCCO`). (C) IR no peaks → THF (`C1CCOC1`)."
"Problem 8: \( t \)-BuOH + MeCN → product with IR 3435/1686 cm⁻¹, NMR 169/50/29/25 ppm. Identify the product. SMILES: `CC(C)(C)C(=O)NC`","The product is \( N \)-tert-butylacetamide (`CC(C)(C)C(=O)NC`), formed via nucleophilic addition of \( t \)-BuOH to MeCN under acidic conditions."
"Problem 9: How many trichlorobenzene isomers exist? Can \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR distinguish them? SMILES: `C1=C(C=C(C(=C1)Cl)Cl)Cl`","Three isomers: 1,2,3-, 1,2,4-, and 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene. \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR distinguishes them via signal count: 1,3,5- (2 signals), 1,2,3- (4 signals), 1,2,4- (6 signals)."
