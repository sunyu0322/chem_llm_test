"How does the mass spectrum gives evidence of isotopes in the compounds of bromine, onlorine, and carbon? Assuming the molecular ion of each of these compounds is of 100% abundance, what peaks (and in what intensity) would appear around that mass number? (a) \( {\mathrm{C}}_{5}{\mathrm{H}}_{5}\mathrm{{BrO}} \) ,(b) \( {\mathrm{C}}_{60} \) ,(c) \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{4}\mathrm{{BrCl}} \) ? Give in cases (a) and (c) a possible structure for the compound. What compound is (b)?","Bromine has two isotopes, \( {}^{79}\mathrm{{Br}} \) and \( {}^{81}\mathrm{{Br}} \) ,in about a 1:1 ratio,chlorine has two, \( {}^{35}\mathrm{{Cl}} \) and \( {}^{37}\mathrm{{Cl}} \) ,in about a 3:1 ratio and there is about \( {1.1}\% {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) in normal compounds. Hence the molecular ions of \( \rightarrow \) three compounds will be as follows.\n`C1=C(C=CC(=C1)Cl)Br` `CC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1` `C1=CC=C(C(=C1)Br)Cl` `C(CO)Br` `C(=O)=O`"
"The \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR spectrum for ethyl benzoate contains these peaks: 17.3,61.1,100-150 o.p.m. (four peaks), and 166.8 p.p.m. Which peak belongs to which carbon atom?","`CC(C[Z13])OC(=O)C1=C(C2=C(C=CC=C2)C=C1)[R20]` There are four different types of carbon atom in the benzene ring (don't forget the 'ipso' carbon joined to the substituent) and it is not easy to say which is which. The rest can be deduced from the four main regions."
"The thinner used in typists’ correction fluids is a single compound, \( {\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{3}{\mathrm{{Cl}}}_{3} \) ,having \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR peaks at 45.1 and 95.0 p.p.m. What is its structure? ...","`C(C(Cl)Cl)Cl` `CC(Cl)(Cl)Cl` `C[C@@]12CC([C@@]1(C)O[Sb]O2)[Z13]` The observed shifts are 50 p.p.m. apart and the compound is 1,1,1-trichloroethane. The mixture likely contains butanone as a carbonyl compound."
"The ’normal’ O-H stretch (i.e. without hydrogen bonding) comes at about \( {3600}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) . What is the reduced mass \( \left( \mu \right) \) for \( \mathrm{O} - \mathrm{H} \) ? ...","`C1C(=O)CN1` `C1CNC1=O` `C(=CN)C([2H])=O` `C=CC(=O)N` The reduced mass \( \mu = \frac{16}{17} \) for O-H. \( \mathrm{O} - \mathrm{D} \) and \( \mathrm{S} - \mathrm{H} \) have similar reduced masses but differ in bond strength."
"Three compounds,each having the formula \( {\mathrm{C}}_{3}{\mathrm{H}}_{5}\mathrm{{NO}} \) ,have the IR spectra summarized here. ...","`C1C(=O)CN1` `C1CNC1=O` `[82Ga]` `C(=CN)C([2H])=O` `C=CC(=O)N` `[Mn]` `C(C#N)CO` `CC(C#N)O` `[Cu]`"

"How many isomers of trichlorobenzene are there? The 1,2,3-trichloro isomer is illustrated. Could they be distinguished by \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR?","`C1=C(C=C(C(=C1)Cl)Cl)Cl` Three isomers exist. \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR distinguishes them by signal count: 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene (2 signals), 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene (4 signals), and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (6 signals)."
"How many signals would you expect in the \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR of the following compounds?","`C1C2CC3CC1CC(C2)C3` `C1=CC2=C(C=C1)C=CC=C2` `C1=CC(=O)C=CC1=O` `C(CN(CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O)N(CC(=O)O)CC(=O)O` `C(CO)N(CCO)CCO`"
