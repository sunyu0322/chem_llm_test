"## Problem 1\nIf you wanted to separate a mixture of naphthalene, pyridine, and \( p \)-toluic acid, how would you go about it? SMILES: C1=CC2=C(C=C1)C=CC=C2 (naphthalene), CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O (\( p \)-toluic acid), CCCCCCCCC (invalid/unrelated)","Suggested solution: Pyridine is a weak base (\( \mathrm{p}K_a 5.5 \)) and can be dissolved in aqueous acid. \( p \)-Toluic acid is a weak acid (\( \mathrm{p}K_a \sim4.5 \)) and can be dissolved in aqueous base. Naphthalene is neutral. Dissolve the mixture in an organic solvent (e.g., ether or dichloromethane), extract with aqueous acid (\( \mathrm{pH} < 4 \)) to remove protonated pyridine, then extract the organic layer with aqueous base (\( \mathrm{pH} > 6 \)) to extract \( p \)-toluic acid as its anion. Recrystallize naphthalene from the organic layer, acidify the basic solution to precipitate \( p \)-toluic acid, and basify the acidic solution to recover pyridine via extraction."
"## Problem \nIn the separation of benzoic acid from toluene using \( \mathrm{NaOH} \) solution, how concentrated a solution is needed to ensure \( \mathrm{pH} > \mathrm{p}K_a \) of benzoic acid (4.2)? How to estimate the required volume?","Suggested solution: Even dilute \( \mathrm{NaOH} \) (e.g., \( 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{mol \, dm^{-3}} \)) achieves \( \mathrm{pH} > 4.2 \). However, stoichiometric \( \mathrm{OH^-} \) is needed to deprotonate benzoic acid. For \( 1.22 \, \mathrm{g} \) benzoic acid (\( 0.01 \, \mathrm{mol} \)), \( 1000 \, \mathrm{L} \) of \( 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{M} \, \mathrm{NaOH} \) would be required. Practically, use \( 0.1 \, \mathrm{M} \, \mathrm{NaOH} \) (pH 13) requiring only \( 100 \, \mathrm{mL} \) for efficient extraction."
"## Problem 3\nWhat species would be present if you were to dissolve this hydroxy-acid in: (a) water at \( \mathrm{{pH}}7 \) ; (b) aqueous alkali at \( \mathrm{{pH}}{12} \) ; or (c) a concentrated solution of a mineral acid?\n<!-- Media -->\n`C1=C(C=CC(=C1)O)C(=O)O`","## Suggested solution\nAt \( \mathrm{{pH}}7 \), the carboxylic acid group ionizes (pKa ~4-5). At \( \mathrm{{pH}}{12} \), both carboxylic acid and phenolic OH groups ionize (pKa ~10). In strong acid, both groups remain protonated, with carboxylic acid potentially over-protonated.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C1=C(C=CC(=C1)O)C(=O)[O-].C1=C(C=CC(=C1)O)C(=O)O`"
"## Problem 4\nWhat would you expect to be the site of (a) protonation and (b) deprotonation if the compounds below were treated with an appropriate acid or base? In each case suggest a suitable acid or base for both purposes.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C1CCNCC1`","## Suggested solution\nPiperidine (tertiary amine) protonates at N with weak acids (e.g., HCl). Deprotonation requires strong bases (e.g., BuLi) due to high pKa (~30-35).\n<!-- Media -->\n`C1CCN(CC1)Cl.C1CCNCC1`"
"## Problem 5\nSuggest what species would be formed by each of these combinations of reagents. You are advised to use \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) values to help you and to beware of some cases where ’no change’ might be the answer.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C1=CC=C(C=C1)[O-].C(=O)(C(F)(F)F)[O-]`","## Suggested solution\nPhenoxide (pKa ~10) deprotonates trifluoroacetic acid (pKa ~0), forming phenol and trifluoroacetate. Imidazole (pKa ~7) partially deprotonates carboxylic acids.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C1=CC=C(C=C1)O.C(=O)(C(F)(F)F)[O-]`"
"## Problem 6\nWhat is the relationship between these two molecules? Discuss the structure of the anion that would be formed by the deprotonation of each compound.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C1=CC(=O)NC=C1`","## Suggested solution\nTautomers differing in proton position. Deprotonation forms a delocalized anion stabilized by conjugation, with equivalent structures regardless of initial tautomer.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C1=CC(=O)NC=C1.C1=CC(=NC=C1)[O-]`"
"## Problem 7\nWhat species would be formed by treating this compound with: (a) one equivalent; (b) two equivalents of \( {\mathrm{{NaNH}}}_{2} \) in liquid ammonia?\n<!-- Media -->\n`C#CCCCCO[Si](N(C)C)(N(C)C)N(C)C`","## Suggested solution\nFirst equivalent deprotonates the alcohol (pKa ~16), forming alkoxide. Second equivalent deprotonates the alkyne (pKa ~25), yielding a dianion.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C#CCCCCO[Si](N(C)C)(N(C)C)N(C)C`"
"## Problem 8\nThe carbon NMR spectra of these compounds could be run in \( {\mathrm{D}}_{2}\mathrm{O} \) under the conditions shown. Why were these conditions necessary and what spectrum would you expect to observe?\n<!-- Media -->\n`C1=CC2=C(C=C1)N=C(N)N2`","## Suggested solution\nAcidic/basic conditions exchange labile protons (NH/OH), sharpening spectra. Guanidine forms a symmetrical cation in acid (3 unique carbons). Phenol becomes a delocalized anion in base (5 signals).\n<!-- Media -->\n`C1=CC2=C(C=C1)N=C(N2)N(Cl)Cl`"
"## Problem 9\nThe phenols shown here have approximate \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) values of4,7,9,10,and 11. Suggest with explanations which \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) value belongs to which phenol.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C1=C(C=C(C(=C1)O)S(=O)(=O)O)[N+](=O)[O-]`","## Suggested solution\nPhenol (pKa ~10). Nitrophenol (pKa ~7). Dinitrophenol (pKa ~4). Chlorophenol (pKa ~9). Trimethylphenol (pKa ~11). Electron-withdrawing groups (NO₂, SO₂O⁻) increase acidity.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C1=C(C=CC(=C1)S(=O)(=O)Cl)O`"
"## Problem 10\nDiscuss the stabilization of the anions formed by the deprotonation of (a) and (b) and the cation formed by the protonation of (c). Consider delocalization in general and the possibility of aromaticity in particular.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C1=CC(=CC2=CC=CN2[R])N=C1`","## Suggested solution\n(a) Delocalized over 4 N atoms (aromatic). (b) Phenoxide with ketone conjugation. (c) Diamine cation with dual aromatic rings (12 π-electrons).\n<!-- Media -->\n`C1=CC(=CC(=C1)C2=NN(N=N2)[R])[R12]`"

Assign these to functional groups and draw structures at pH 1, 5, 9, 12.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)S`","## Suggested solution\n1.8 (carboxylic acid), 8.3 (thiol), 10.8 (amine). At pH 1: fully protonated. pH 5: zwitterion. pH 9: thiolate + carboxylate. pH 12: dianion.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)SC#C[S-]`"
"## Problem 12\nExplain the variations in the \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) values for these carbon acids.\n<!-- Media -->\n`CC(=O)CC(=O)O`","## Suggested solution\n1,3-Dicarbonyl (pKa ~5-15) vs. mono-carbonyl (pKa ~15-20).
