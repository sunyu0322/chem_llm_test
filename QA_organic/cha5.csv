question,answer
"Problem 1: Each of these molecules is electrophilic. Identify the electrophilic atom and draw a mechanism for reaction with a generalized nucleophile \( {\mathrm{Nu}}^{-} \) . SMILES: C1CC(=O)OC(=O)C1 (succinic anhydride), CCOCCSSCC (diethyl thiosulfate), COC(=O)OC (carbonic acid ester), C1CC(=O)C1 (cyclobutanone),
"Problem 2: Each of these molecules is nucleophilic. Identify the nucleophilic atom and draw a mechanism for reaction with a generalized electrophile \( {\mathrm{E}}^{ + } \) . SMILES: COP(OC)OC (phosphate), C(=S)([R])[S-] (thiolate), NN (hydrazine)","Suggested solution: Nucleophilic sites: sulfur in thiolate (C(=S)[S-]), phosphorus in phosphate (COP(OC)OC), and nitrogen in hydrazine (NN). Mechanisms involve attack on \( {\mathrm{E}}^{ + } \) via lone pairs or σ-bonds. Phosphate uses non-oxygen lone pairs due to higher energy phosphorus orbitals."
"Problem 3: Complete these mechanisms by drawing the product structures. SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC3(CCC(CC3)O)C1CC2 (steroid derivative), C1CC2CC[NH2+]CCC2CC1 (amine)","Suggested solution: Products formed via bond-breaking/making guided by curly arrows. Steroid derivative undergoes ring-opening, amine forms quaternary ammonium salt. Key steps: proton transfer and nucleophilic substitution."
"Problem 4: Identify electrophilic atoms in these compounds and draw reaction mechanisms with nucleophiles. SMILES: C(CC(=O)[O-])CO (carboxylate), CC([R6]([H])([H])[H])[Pb] (organolead)","Suggested solution: Electrophilic sites: carbonyl carbon (C(CC(=O)[O-])CO) and lead atom (CC[Pb]). Nucleophiles attack at these sites, displacing leaving groups (e.g., bromide) or forming new bonds via lone pairs."
"Problem 5: Add arrows to these structures to show reaction mechanisms leading to the products. SMILES: C=C1C(CCCC1Br)CCCCCC(=C)[O-] (brominated terpene), C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O (benzoic acid)","Suggested solution: Arrows show electron movement: bromide departure (C=C1C(CCCC1Br)CCCCCC(=C)[O-]) and proton transfer (benzoic acid). Key steps: E2 elimination and acid-base reactions."
"Problem 6: Draw mechanisms for these reactions. SMILES: C1=CC=C(C=C1)O[CH2-] (phenol ether), CCCSCCC (thioether)","Suggested solution: Phenol ether undergoes nucleophilic substitution (OH⁻ displaces Br⁻). Thioether forms via S⁻ attack on alkyl halide. HBr protonates intermediates for neutralization."
"Problem 7: Mechanism for \( {\mathrm{PhCHBr}}_{1}{\mathrm{CHBr}}_{2}{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}\mathrm{H} + {\mathrm{NaHCO}}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{PhCH=CHBr} \) . SMILES: C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C(C(=O)O)Br)Br (dibromocinnamic acid)","Suggested solution: \( {\mathrm{HCO}}_{3}^{-} \) deprotonates carboxylic acid. Cyclic transition state forms double bond, expelling \( {\mathrm{CO}}_{2} \) and bromide. Final product: PhCH=CHBr via decarboxylation."
