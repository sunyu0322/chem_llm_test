"Each of these molecules is electrophilic. Identify the electrophilic atom and draw a mechanism for reaction with a generalized nucleophile \( {\mathrm{{Nu}}}^{ - } \) , giving the product in each case.","Electrophilic sites include carbonyl carbons, protonated atoms, or strained bonds. The nucleophile attacks the electrophilic site, breaking or forming bonds as needed. For example, in acyl chlorides, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon, displacing chloride. In epoxides, ring strain facilitates nucleophilic attack at either carbon, opening the ring."
"Each of these molecules is nucleophilic. Identify the nucleophilic atom and draw a mechanism for reaction with a generalized electrophile \( {\mathrm{E}}^{ + } \) , giving the product in each case.","Nucleophilic sites include lone pairs on nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, or π-bonds. The nucleophile donates electrons to the electrophile, forming a bond. For instance, amines can attack carbonyl carbons, while thiols react with alkyl halides via \( S_N2 \) substitution."
"Complete these mechanisms by drawing the structure of the products in each case.","Products are formed by following electron movements indicated by curly arrows. Bonds form or break based on the flow of electrons. For example, epoxide ring-opening results in alcohol formation, and nucleophilic addition to carbonyls forms tetrahedral intermediates."
"Each of these electrophiles could react with a nucleophile at (at least) two different atoms. Identify these atoms and draw a mechanism for each reaction together with the products from each.","Electrophiles like α,β-unsaturated carbonyls allow 1,2- or 1,4-addition. Nucleophiles may attack directly at the carbonyl carbon (1,2-addition) or conjugate-add to the β-carbon (1,4-addition), yielding distinct products depending on reaction conditions."
"Put in the arrows on these structures (which have been drawn with all the atoms in the right places!) to give the products shown.","Arrows should start from electron-rich regions (e.g., lone pairs or π-bonds) and point toward electron-deficient regions (e.g., electrophilic atoms). Ensure that bond-making and bond-breaking processes align with the given products."
"Draw mechanisms for these reactions. The starting materials have not necessarily been drawn in a helpful way.","Redraw structures if necessary to clarify reactive sites. Use knowledge of common reaction types (e.g., substitutions, additions, eliminations) to propose reasonable mechanisms consistent with the reagents and products provided."
"Draw a mechanism for this reaction: \( {\mathrm{{PhCHBr}}}_{1}{\mathrm{{CHBr}}}_{2}{\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} + {\mathrm{{NaHCO}}}_{3} \rightarrow  \mathrm{{PhCH}} = \mathrm{{CHB}} \)","The carboxylic acid proton is abstracted by bicarbonate (\( {\mathrm{{HCO}}}_{3}^{-} \)), generating a carboxylate anion. This intermediate undergoes decarboxylation, losing \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2} \) and forming a stabilized enolate, which eliminates bromide to produce the final alkene product."
