"problem 1 In the method for acetylating aromatic amines described in Chapter 8, p. 188 (the Lumière-Barbier method) the amine was dissolved in aqueous HCl. Using 1M amine, \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}{4.6} \) ,and 1M \( \mathrm{{HCl}},\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} - 7 \) ,what will be the approximate equilibrium constant in the reaction?<!-- Media --><!-- figureText: \( \mathop{\bigcup }\limits^{
ot{} }{A}^{N{H}_{2}} \cdot  {HX} \rightarrow  \mathop{\bigcup }\limits^{
ot{} }{A}^{N{H}_{3}} \cdot  {X}^{O{H}_{2}} \) -->`C1=CC=C(C=C1)N.C1=CC=C(C=C1)N.CC#C[NH-].[K+]`<!-- Media -->The next step in the reaction is the addition of acetic anhydride and sodium acetate. What will happen to the sodium acetate (NaOAc) in the aqueous solution of HCI? Estimate the equilibrium constant for the reaction between NaOAc and HCl. Will there be enough acid left to keep the amine in solution?<!-- Media --><!-- figureText: \( {
abla }^{N{H}_{2}} \cdot  {HCl} = {
abla }^{N{H}_{2}}\;{C}^{0}\frac{1}{{N}_{0}}{
abla }^{N} \) -->`CC(=O)NC1=CC=CC=C1.C1=CC=C(C=C1)N.C1=CC=C(C=C1)N.CC(=O)OC(=O)C.C#C[Hg].CC(=O)[O-].[Cl-].[I-].[Na+].[Na+].[Na+]`<!-- Media -->It would be simpler not to add the sodium acetate,keeping the \( \mathrm{{pH}} \) low,and thus definitely keep all the amine in solution. Why is it necessary to raise the \( \mathrm{{pH}} \) for the second step of the reaction (the reaction with acetic anhydride)?","suggested solution 1 The equilibrium constant is enormous due to a 11.6 pKa difference. Sodium acetate reacts with HCl (pKa ~5 vs -7) forming acetic acid (pKa ~5) and Cl⁻. The equilibrium favors acetic acid, leaving ~1:1 ratio with PhNH₃⁺. Without NaOAc, all amine remains protonated (no nucleophile)."

If you were to react an ester with acid, which of the two would you form and why?","suggested solution 2 Left cation has delocalized charge over two O atoms (C(=O)(O)[R1]). Ester protonation at methoxy oxygen forms the more stable cation (delocalization via [Y]([H])([H])[H])."
"problem 3 If we carry out an eater exchange reaction on a one molar solution of \( {\mathrm{{MeCO}}}_{2}{\mathrm{R}}^{2} \) in an alcohol \( {\mathrm{R}}^{2}\mathrm{{OH}} \) as solvent with catalytic \( {\mathrm{R}}^{2}{\mathrm{O}}^{ + } \) and let the mixture reach equilibrium,what will be the equilibrium composition if the solvent alcohol \( {\mathrm{B}}^{ + }\mathrm{{OH}} \) is,say, \( {25}\mathrm{M} \) in itself?<!-- Media --><!-- figureText: \( \frac{\rho }{{R}_{0}^{2}{R}_{2}^{2}}\frac{{R}^{2}{0}^{1/3}}{{R}^{2}{OH}} = {I}_{OH} \) -->`CC(=O)O.CC(=O)O.CC(O)[R4].CO[R3]`<!-- Media -->","suggested solution 3 Equilibrium constant ≈1. With [R²OH] =25M, MeCO₂R² dominates (96%) due to Le Chatelier's principle: \( K = \frac{[{\mathrm{R}}^{2}\mathrm{{OH}}][{\mathrm{{MeCO}}}_{2}{\mathrm{R}}^{1}]}{[{\mathrm{R}}^{1}\mathrm{{OH}}][{\mathrm{{MeCO}}}_{2}{\mathrm{R}}^{2}]} \)."

"problem 7 Draw an energy profile diagram for this reaction. You will, of course, need to draw a mechanism first. Suggest which step in the mechanism is likely to be the slow step and what kinetics would be observed.<!-- Media -->`C1CCC(C1)(C#N)O.C1CCC(=O)C1.CC.C(#N)[Na].Cl.O`<!-- Media -->","suggested solution 7 First step (bimolecular C-C bond formation) is rate-determining. Intermediate anion (higher energy) → fast proton transfer. Energy profile shows high initial barrier. Kinetics: rate = [ketone][HO⁻]²."
"problem 8 The equilibrium between a carbonyl compound and its hydrate usually favours the aldehyde or ketone. Draw an energy profile to express this and mark the difference in free energy between the two compounds. The hydrate of cyclopropanone is preferred to the ketone. HCo. does the energy profile change for this compound?<!-- Media -->`C1CC(=O)C(C1)O.C1CCC(C1)(O)O.C1CC1=O.C1CC1(O)O`<!-- Media -->","suggested solution 8 Cyclopropanone hydrate (C1CC(=O)C(C1)O) is more stable due to relieved ring strain.
