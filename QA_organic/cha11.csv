"Problem 1: How many signals will there be in the \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR spectrum of each of these compounds? Estimate the chemical shifts of the signals. Purpose of the problem: Simple revision of symmetry with adjustment to proton rather than carbon NMR and chemical shift. Media: `CC(C)(C)[Si](C)(C)N(C(=O)C(F)(F)F)S(=O)(=O)C.CC1(C)CC(=O)CC(C)(C)N1.CC(C)(C)OC(=O)[Al].CC(N(C)C)(OC)OC.C1=NC=NC=N1`",Suggested solution: You should find the symmetry easy now and this is the answer with different types of proton marked with different letters. Media: `CC(C)(C)N(C)N(C(=O)C(F)(F)F)O.CC(C)(C)N(C)N(C(=O)C(F)(F)F)O.CC(C)(C)N(C)N(C(=O)C(F)(F)F)O.CC(C)(C)N(C)N(C(=O)C(F)(F)F)[R1].C1(=NC(=NC(=N1)[X7])[X7])[O-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[CH3-].[C` Estimating the chemical shift requires an adjustment to the narrower range of proton shifts plus a new region - aromatic as distinct from alkene. In each case we give a reasonable estimate and then the actual values. If your values agree with our estimates, you have done well. If you get something near the actual values,be very proud of yourself. The first compound has hydrogens on \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2} \) carbon atoms bonded to two nitrogen atoms - hence the very large shift. The fourth molecule has two methyl groups directly bonded to electropositive silicon - hence the very small shift. The rest are more easily explained.

"Problem 2: Comment on the chemical shifts of these three compounds and suggest whether there is a worthwhile correlation with \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) . Media: <table><tr><td>Compound</td><td>\( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) ,p.p.m.</td><td>pKa</td></tr><tr><td>CH3NO2</td><td>4.33</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>\( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}{\left( {\mathrm{{NO}}}_{2}\right) }_{2} \)</td><td>6.10</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>\( \mathrm{{CH}}{\left( {\mathrm{{NO}}}_{2}\right) }_{3} \)</td><td>7.52</td><td>0</td></tr></table> Purpose of the problem: Simple correlation of structure and chemical shift.",Suggested solution: The nitro group is a strongly electron-withdrawing group and would be expected to remove electron shielding from neighbouring hydrogen atoms. A \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{3} \) group would normally come at about 1.2 p.p.m. so one nitro group has shifted this downfield by about 3 p.p.m. The second adds less than 2 p.p.m. and the third only just 1.4 p.p.m. These diminishing effects are much smaller than the effects on \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) ,which is a log scale, but in the same direction. There is a kind of correlation showing that removing electrons from a \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{H} \) bond makes it more acidic and also increases the chemical shift."
"Problem 3: One isomer of dimethoxybenzoic acid has the \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR spectrum \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) (p.p.m.) 3.85 (6H,s), 6.63 (1H,t,J 2Hz),7.17 (2H,d,J 2Hz) and one isomer of coumalic acid has the \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR spectrum \( {\delta }_{H} \) (p.p.m.) 6.41 (1H,d,J 10 Hz),7.82 (1H,dd,J 2,10 Hz),and 8.51 (1H,d, \( \mathrm{J}2\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) ).

There is only one structure that answers these criteria. The compound is 3,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid. Media: `COC1=C(C(=C(C2=C1N3CCCCCN(CCCCC3)C4=C(C(=C(C(=C4OC)OC)N2)NCCCCCN)C(=O)O)C(=O)O)NCCCCCN)OC.CCCCCCNC1=C(C(=C(C(=C1OC)NCCCCCC)C(=O)O)NCCCCCC)C(=O)O.CCCCCCNC1=C(C(=C(C(=C1OC)NCCCCCC)C(=O)O)NCCCCCC)C(=O)O.[Sm].[Sm]` The second compound has one coupling of \( {10}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) and this must be between neighbours. The other coupling is \( 2\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) and this must be meta coupling. There are two structures that might be right. In fact, the first is correct and you might have worked that out by the very large chemical shift - almost in the aldehyde region - of the isolated proton with only a \( 2\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) coupling. This is on - alkene carbon bonded to oxygen in the first structure but on a simple alkene carbon in the second.

"Problem 4: Assign the NMR spectra of this compound (assign means say which signal belongs to which atom) and justify your assignments. Media: `CC1=CC(C)(C)OC(=O)C1` Purpose of the problem: Effectice in the interpretation of real NMR spectra - this is harder than if the spectra have already Eth measured.",Suggested solution: There is no coupling in the proton NMR spectrum, which makes it much easier, but you should The aberration chierical shifts and estimate the number of protons in each signal from the integration. \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) (p.p.m.) 1.4 (6H),1.8 (3H),2.9 (2H),and 5.5 (1H). The peak at 7.25 p.p.m. is \( {\mathrm{{CHCl}}}_{3} \) impurity in the \( {\mathrm{{CDCl}}}_{3} \) solvent. Media: `CC1=CC(C)(C)OC(=O)C1.[13CH4].[13CH4].[13CH4]` This is enough to assign the spectrum but we should check that the chemical shifts are right too, and they are. The carbon spectrum is more familiar to you from Chapter 3 and you will remember that regration means little here. There are three peaks in the \( 0 - {50} \) p.p.m. region corresponding to the The thyl group on the alkene,the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) group,and the pair of methyls on the same carbon atom. The 11:1 triplet at 77 p.p.m. is the solvent \( {\mathrm{{CDCl}}}_{3} \) . The other signal in the \( {50} - {100} \) p.p.m. region must be the carbon next to oxygen \( \left( {{\mathrm{{Me}}}_{2}\mathrm{{CO}}}\right) \) . The two signals in the 100-150 p.p.m. region are the two Errions of the alkene and the very small peak above 150 p.p.m. must be the carbonyl group. No further assignment is necessary."
"Problem 5: Assign the \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR spectra of these compounds and explain the multiplicity of the signals. Media: `[CH]CCC[N+](=O)[O-]` `CC(C)N1CCC(=O)CC1` `CCCC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1` \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) (p.p.m.) \( {0.97}\left( {3\mathrm{H},\mathrm{t},\mathrm{J}7\mathrm{{Hz}}}\right) \) , \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) (p.p.m.) 1.08 (6H,d,J 7 Hz), \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) (p.p.m.) \( {1.00}\left( {3\mathrm{H},\mathrm{t},\mathrm{J}7\mathrm{\;{Hz}}}\right) \) , 1.42 (2H, sextuplet, J 7 Hz), 2.45 (4H, t, J 5 Hz), 1.75 (2H, sextuplet, J 7 Hz), \( {2.00}\left( {2\mathrm{H}\text{,quintet,}\mathrm{J}7\mathrm{{Hz}}}\right) \) , \( {2.80}\left( {4\mathrm{H},\mathrm{t},\mathrm{J}5\mathrm{{Hz}}}\right) \) , 2.91 (2H, t, J 7 Hz), 4.40 (2H, t, J 7 Hz) 2.93 (1H, septuplet, J 7 Hz) \( {7.47.9}\left( {5\mathrm{H},\mathrm{m}}\right) \) Purpose of the problem: First serious practice in correlating splitting patterns and chemical shifts.",Suggested solution: Redrawing the molecules with all hydrogens showing probably helps at this stage, though you will not do this for long. The spectrum of 1-nitrobutane can be assigned by integration and splitting pattern without even looking at the chemical shifts! Just counting the number of neighbours and adding one gives the multiplicity of the signals and leads to the assignment in the frame. It is equally valid to start with the chemical shift,which you would expect to get steadily smaller as the \( \mathrm{H} \) atoms are more distant from the \( {\mathrm{{NO}}}_{2} \) group. Everything fits.

Assigning the two triplets is not so easy as the chemical shift difference is very small (0.35 p.p.m.) and it is safer not to say which is which. This uncertainty does not affect our identification of the compound.

This is not unusual and a signal in the \( {6.5} - 8 \) region described as ’ \( 5\mathrm{H} \) ,m’ usually means a monosubstituted benzene ring. The side chain is straightforward with the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) next to the ketone coming at larger chemical shift. All the coupling constants happen to be the same(7Hz)as we expect for a freely rotating open-chain compound.

"Problem 6: The reaction below was expected to give product \( 6\mathrm{\;A} \) and did indeed give a product with the correct molecular formula by mass spectrum. The \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR spectrum of the product was however: \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) (p.p.m.) 1.27 (6H,s),1.70 (4H,m),2.88 (2H,m),5.4-6.1 (2H,broad s, exchanges with \( {\mathrm{D}}_{2}\mathrm{O} \) ), 7.0-7.5 (3H,m). Though the detail is missing from this spectrum,how can you already tell that this is not the compound expected? Media: `CC1(C)CCCC2=C(C=CC=C2)NC1=O.CC1(C)CCCC2=C(C=CC=C2)NC1=O.[B].[B].[B].[B]` Purpose of the problem: To show that it is helpful to predict the NMR spectrum of an expected product provided that the structure is rejected if the spectrum is 'wrong'.",Suggested solution: The spectrum is all wrong. There are only three aromatic Hs (7.0-7.5 p.p.m.), not the four expected. There are two exchanging hydrogens,presumably \( {\mathrm{{NH}}}_{2} \) ,and not the one expected. The only thing 3. is as expected is the chain of three \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) groups. You could not be expected to find the right structure, which is actually an amide with a new carbocyclic ring. Media: `CC/1(C)CCCC2=C1C=CC=C2C(=O)N.CC/1(C)CCCC2=C(C=CC=C2)\C1=N/O.CC.[CH3-].[Y]` This surprising result was reported by B. Amit and A. Hassner, Synthesis, 1978, 932. The expected reaction was the Beckmann rearrangement (Chapter 37) but what actually happened was a Beckmann fragmentation (Chapter 38) followed by an intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation (Chapter 22)."
"Problem 7: Assign the \( {400}\mathrm{{MHz}}{}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR spectrum of this enynone as far as possible,justifying both chemical shifts and coupling patterns. Media: `C#CCCCC(=O)CCC=C` Purpose of the problem: where at interpretation of high-field NMR spectra. More complex problems can be solved - onably easily.",Suggested solution: Text measure the spectrum and list the data. The expansions make it much easier to see the Sing but even so we are going to have to call the signal at 5.6 p.p.m. a multiplet. For the rest of 3 - agnals,you should have measured the \( J \) values. Coupling is measured in \( \mathrm{{Hz}} \) and at \( {400}\mathrm{{MHz}} \) such chemical shift unit of 1 p.p.m. is \( {400}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) ,so each subunit of 0.1 p.p.m. is \( {40}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) .

If you were surprised by its small chemical shift, check the tables and as all right. In the alkene region,the multiplet must be \( {\mathrm{H}}^{2} \) which couples to the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) at \( \mathrm{C}3 \) and H s. On \( \mathrm{{Cl}},{\mathrm{H}}^{1\mathrm{a}} \) has a large trans coupling(16Hz)to \( {\mathrm{H}}^{2} \) while \( {\mathrm{H}}^{1\mathrm{\;b}} \) has a smaller \( c \) is coupling (M Hz). The coupling between \( {\mathrm{H}}^{1\mathrm{a}} \) and \( {\mathrm{H}}^{1\mathrm{\;b}} \) is very small. Media: `C([2H])([2H])=C([2H])CCC(=O)CCCC#C[2H]` Of the five \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) groups,the quintet at small chemical shift must be at C7. Those at \( \mathrm{C}4,\mathrm{C}6 \) ,and C8 have two neighbours and are basically triplets, but that at C3 couples to three protons and must be the quartet at \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{2.32} \) p.p.m."
"Problem 8: A nitration product \( \left( {{\mathrm{C}}_{8}{\mathrm{H}}_{11}{\mathrm{\;N}}_{3}{\mathrm{O}}_{2}}\right) \) of this pyridine has been isolated which has a nitro \( \left( {\mathrm{{NO}}}_{2}\right) \) group somewhere on the molecule. From the \( {90}\mathrm{{MHz}}{}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR spectrum,deduce whether the nitro group is (a) on the ring, (b) on the NH nitrogen atom, or (c) on the aliphatic side chain and then exactly where it is. Give a full analysis of the spectrum. Media: `CCCN(C1=NC=CC=C1)N(Cl)Cl.CC(CNC1=NC=CC=C1)N(Cl)Cl.CCCNC1=NC(=CC=C1)[N+](=O)[O-]` Purpose of the problem: Practice at interpretation of high-field NMR spectra. More complex problems can be solved reasonably easily.",Suggested solution: Checking the integral will deal with that problem. The propyl side chain is still there with a \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{3} \) triplet,a \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) quintet,and a \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) triplet with a large chemical shift. The broad signal at \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{5.9} \) p.p.m. is typical of an NH group so no reaction has happened there. The small signal - less than a quarter of a proton - at 7.2 p.p.m. cannot be part of the molecule and must be \( {\mathrm{{CHCl}}}_{3} \) . The remaining signals in the aromatic region at 6.3,8.1,and 9.1 p.p.m. must be three protons on the pyridine ring. The nitro group has replaced one of the original four and is somewhere on the pyridine ring. These are the possibilities. Media: `CCCNC1=NC=CC(=C1)N.CCCNC1=NC=CC=C1N.CCCNC1=NC=CC=C1.CCCNC1=NC=CC=C1` The most significant feature of the aromatic region is a proton at very large chemical shift (9.1 p.p.m.) with no coupling to speak of (there might be some long-range coupling). This proton has no neighbours and that rules out the 3-nitro and 6-nitro compounds. If you check in tables you will see that protons on carbons next to nitrogen (C2 and C6) in pyridine have very large shifts as you would expect from their aldehyde-like nature. The nitro group also increases the shifts of protons on neighbouring carbon atoms. The compound must be 5-nitro and the spectrum can be assigned like this. Media: `CCN(CC)C1=C(N=C(C(=C1[R1])N(CC)CC[Y11])N(CC)CC[R13])N(CC)CC.C(CNC1=NC=C(C=N1)[N+](=O)[O-])C[R19].CCCNC1=NC=C(C=N1)[N+](=O)[O-].CC` The coupling in the side chain is all about \( 7\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) as expected and that between \( \mathrm{C}3 \) and \( \mathrm{C}4 \) in the pyridine ring is somewhat larger also as expected for an aromatic ring. The smaller chemical shift of the proton at \( \mathrm{C}3 \) occurs because it is not affected by the nitro group but it is affected by electron donation from the amine nitrogen atom."
"Problem 9: The natural product bullatenone was isolated in the 1950s from a New Zealand myrtle and assigned the structure 9A. Then compound 9A was synthesized and found not to be identical with natural bullatenone. Predict the expected \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR spectrum of 9A. Given the full spectroscopic data available nowadays, but not in the 1950s, say why 9A is definitely wrong and suggest a better structure for builatenone. Media: `CC1COC(=CC1=O)[Pb]` 9A alleged bullatenone Spectra of bullatenone: Mass spectrum: \( \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{z}{188}\left( {{10}\% }\right) \) (high resolution confirms \( {\mathrm{C}}_{12}{\mathrm{H}}_{12}{\mathrm{O}}_{2} \) ), 105 (20%), 102 (100%), and 77 (20%). Infrared: 1604 and \( {1705}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) . \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR: \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) (p.p.m.) 1.45 \( \left( {6\mathrm{H},\mathrm{s}}\right) ,{5.82}\left( {1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{s}}\right) ,{7.35}\left( {3\mathrm{H},\mathrm{m}}\right) \) ,and 7.68(2H,m). Purpose of the problem: Detecting wrong structures is fun and teaches us to be alert to what the spectra are telling us rather than what we expect.",Suggested solution: The mass spectrum and infrared are all right for structure 9A but the NMR shows at once that bullatenone cannot be \( 9\mathrm{\;A} \) . There is indeed a monosubstituted benzene ring (the \( 2\mathrm{H} \) and \( 3\mathrm{H} \) signals in the aromatic region confirm this) but the aliphatic protons consist of a \( 6\mathrm{H} \) signal,almost certainly a \( {\mathrm{{CMe}}}_{2} \) group,and a \( 1\mathrm{H} \) singlet in the alkene region at 5.82 p.p.m. The fragments we have are \( \mathrm{{Ph}} \) ,carbonyl,and \( {\mathrm{{CMe}}}_{2} \) groups and an alkene with one \( \mathrm{H} \) on it. That adds up to \( {\mathrm{C}}_{12}{\mathrm{H}}_{12}\mathrm{O} \) and leaves only one oxygen atom to fit in. There must still be a ring or else there will be too few hydrogen atoms and the ring is five-membered (just try other possibilities yourself). There are three basic rings we can choose and each can have the phenyl group on either end of the double bond making six possibilities in all.

The hydrogen on the alkene cannot be on the same carbon atom as the oxygen or it would be at a very large shift indeed whereas it is close to the 'normal' alkene shift of 5.25 p.p.m. For 9C we could estimate 5.25 + 0.64 p.p.m. for O, + 0.36 p.p.m. for Ph, and \( + {0.87}\mathrm{p} \) .p.m. for \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) making 7.12 p.p.m.,a long way from the observed 5.82 p.p.m. Structure 9B is correct and the spectra can be assigned. Compound \( 9\mathrm{\;B} \) was synthesized and proved identical to natural bullatenone.

"Problem 10: Interpret this \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR spectrum (see text,p. 277,for the 90 MHz NMR of the compound in the margin). Media: `CCOC(=O)C1=C(C)NC2=C1C=C(C=C2)O` Purpose of the problem: Further correlation of chemical shift and coupling with interpretation of longer-range coupling.",Suggested solution: The ethyl group is easy to find - a typical \( 3\mathrm{H} \) triplet at 1.2 p.p.m. and a \( 2\mathrm{H} \) quartet at 4.3 p.p.m. - not just an ethyl group but an OEt group to get the large shift for the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) group. The methyl group is also easy - a \( 3\mathrm{H} \) singlet at 2.6 p.p.m.,typical of a methyl on an alkene. At the other end of the spectrum,the broad signal at 11.0 p.p.m. can be only the \( \mathrm{{NH}} \) or the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) - one exchanges and is not seen. That leaves the three signals in the aromatic region: \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) (p.p.m.) 6.75 (1H,dd,J 9,2 Hz), 7.15 (1H,d,J 9 Hz),and 7.48 (1H,d,J 2 Hz).
