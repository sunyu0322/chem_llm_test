"Draw good diagrams of saturated hydrocarbons with seven carbon atoms having (a) mean, (b) branched, and (c) tycks frameworks. Draw molecules based on each framework having both ketone and carboxylic adic functional groups.","There is only one linear saturated hydrocarbon with seven carbon atoms but there is a wide choice for the rest. We offer some possibilities but you may well have thought of others. `CC1CCCCCC1.CC1CCCCC1.CC1CCCC1.CC1CCCC1.CC1(C)CCCC1.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C.CCCCC(C)C` We give just a few examples for the ketones and carboxylic acids. You will notice that no Cr carbocyclic acid is possible based on, say, cycloheptane without adding an extra carbon atom."
"Study the structure of brevelosis on a. 33. Make a list of the different types of functional group (you already know that there are many effect and of the numbers of range of different states. Finally, study the carbon framework - is in linear, cyclic, or branched?","The ethers are all the unmarked oxygen atoms in the rings: all are cyclic, seven in six-membered rings, two in seven-membered rings, and one in an eight-membered ring. There are two carbonyl groups, one an ester and one an aldehyde, and three alkenes. `CC(C)C1=CC(=O)O[C@@]2(C)C[C@@]3(C)[C@@](C)(C[C@@]4(C)[C@@](C)(C[C@@H]([C@@]5(C)[C@@](C)(CC[C@@]6(C)[C@@](C)(C[C@@]7(C)[C@@](C)(C[C@@H]([C@@]8(C)[C@@](C)(C[C@@]9(C)[C@@](C)(C[C@@]%10(C)[C@@](C)(C[C@@H](C[C@@H](CC(=O)C(C)(C)OC=O)O%10)O9)O8)O7)O6)OC)O5)O4)O3)OC=O)O2)O1` The carbon chain is branched because it has seven methyl groups branching off it and the aldehyde is also a branch. Amazingly, under this disguise, you can detect a basically linear carbon chain, shown with a thick black line, although it twists and turns throughout the entire molecule!"
"What is wrong with these structures? Suggest better ways of representing these molecules.","The bond angles are grotesque with square planar saturated carbon,alkynes at \( {120}^{ \circ  } \) ,alkenes at \( {180}^{ \circ  } \) , bonds coming off benzene rings at the wrong angle, and so on. The left-hand structure would be clearer if most of the hydrogens were omitted. Here are two possible better structures for each molecule. There are many other correct possibilities. `CC#CC(/C=C/C1=CC=C(C=C1)N)O.CC#CC(/C=C/C1=CC=C(C=C1)N)O.CC(=O)NCN1CCCC1.CC(=O)NCN1CCCC1`"
"Draw structures corresponding to these names. In each case suggest alternative names that might convey the structure more clearly to someone who is listening to you speak.\n(a) 1,4-di-(1,1-dimethylethyl)benzene\n(b) 3-(prop-2-enyloxy)prop-1-ene\n(c) cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene","(a) 1,4-di-(1,1-dimethylethyl)benzene. More helpful name para-di-t-butyl benzene. It is sold as 1,4-di-tert-butyl benzene, an equally helpful name. `CC(C)(C)C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)(C)C.CC(C)(C)C1=CC=CC=C1`\n(b) 3-(prop-2-enyloxy)prop-1-ene. This name does not convey the simple symmetrical structure nor that it contains two allyl groups. Most chemists would call this 'diallyl ether' though it is sold as 'allyl ether'. `CC1=CC2=C(C=C1)N=C(C3=CC4=C(C=C3)N=C(C5=CC=CC=C5)N4)N2`\n(c) cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene. This is, of course, benzene, but even IUPAC has not tried to impose this 'correct' name for such an important compound."
"Draw one possible structure for each of these molecules, selecting any group of your choice for the 'wild card' substituents.","There are,of course,many possible solutions. \( \mathrm{X} \) could be a heteroatom or a structural fragment while Ar could be any of a very large number of substituted benzene rings or even other types of aromatic rings. `CC(=C1CC(C1)(C(=O)O)N)C.CS(=O)(=O)CC1OCCO1.COC1(CC(=O)C1)[Pb].CC1(C)CNC1` The three aryl groups in the second example might all be different or some might be the same. In the last two structures we show some unusual aromatic rings including some linked together and one with a nitrogen atom in the ring."
"Translate these very poor 'diagrams' of molecules into more realistic structures. Try to get the angles about right and, whatever you do. don't include any square planar carbon atoms or other bond angles of \( {90}^{ \circ  } \) !\n\( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{5}\mathrm{{CH}}\left( \mathrm{{OH}}\right) .{\left( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\right) }_{4}{\mathrm{{COC}}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{5} \) \( \mathrm{O}{\left( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}{\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\right) }_{2}\mathrm{O} \) \( {\left( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{3}\mathrm{O}\right) }_{2}\mathrm{{CHCH}} = \mathrm{{CHCH}}{\left( \mathrm{{OMe}}\right) }_{2} \)","You probably needed a few trial and error drawings first, but simply drawing out the carbon chains gives you the answers. `CCC(=O)CCCCC(C1=CC=CC=C1)O.COC(C=CC(OC)OC)OC.C1COCCO1` The first is straightforward though you may not previously have seen the dot on the middle of the formula. This does not represent any atom but simply shows that the atom immediately before the dot is not joined to that immediately after it. The second has no ends (Me groups, etc.) and so must be an unbroken ring. The third gives no clue as to the shape of the alkene and we have chosen trans."
"Suggest at least six different structures that would fit the formula \( {\mathrm{C}}_{4}{\mathrm{H}}_{7}\mathrm{{NO}} \) . Make good realistic diagrams of each one and say which functional group(s) are present.","You will have found the carbonyl and amino groups very useful, but did you also use alkenes and alaynes, rings, ethers, alcohols, and cyanides?
