"A compound C6H5FO has a broad peak in the infrared at about 3100-3400 cm^-1 and the following signals in its (proton decoupled) 13C NMR spectrum. Suggest a structure for the compound and interpret the spectra. δC (p.p.m.) 157.38 (doublet, coupling constant 229 Hz), 151.24 (singlet), 116.32 (doublet, coupling constant 7.5 Hz), 116.02 (doublet, coupling constant 23.2 Hz). SMILES: C1=C(C=CC(=C1)O)F","All the signals are in the sp2 region and two (at >150 p.p.m.) are attached to electronegative elements. As the formula is C6, a benzene ring is strongly suggested. The IR peak tells us we have an OH group so the compound is one of these. The symmetry of the spectrum (only four signals) suggests the third compound as the other two would have six different carbon atoms in the ring. We can therefore assign the spectrum by saying that the very large coupling (229 Hz) must be a 2JCF and the zero coupling must be the carbon attached to the OH. The other two signals are the carbons in between and we can assume that, the larger the coupling, the nearer the carbon is to fluorine."
"Suggest structures for the products of these reactions. Compound 2A is C7H12O2 and has: IR 1725 cm^-1; δH (p.p.m.) 1.02 (6H, s), 1.66 (2H, t, J 7 Hz), 2.51 (2H, t, J 7 Hz), and 3.9 (2H, s). Compound 2B has: m/z 149/151 (M+ ratio 3:1); IR 2250 cm^-1; δH (p.p.m.): 2.0 (2H, quintet, J 7 Hz), 2.5 (2H, t, J 7 Hz), 2.9 (2H, t, J 7 Hz), and 4.6 (2H, s). SMILES: CCCC(CCC(=O)O)O","For compound 2A, the starting material is C7H12O3 and has apparently lost an oxygen atom. As the reagent is it is more likely to have gained two hydrogen atoms and lost a water molecule. The IR shows a C=O group and suggests an ester or a strained ketone. The NMR shows two CH2 groups, one (at 2.51 p.p.m.) next to a functional group but not oxygen, presumably the intact CMe2 group, and an isolated CH2 group next to oxygen at 3.9 p.p.m. For compound 2B, the mass spectrum shows chlorine, the IR shows a CN group, and the proton NMR shows eight Hs. Assuming no C atoms have been lost, the most probable formula is C5H8ClNS. The compound has lost a water molecule. The proton NMR shows three linked CH2 groups, a quintet in the middle, and two triplets at the ends. The shifts of the terminal CH2s show they are next to functional groups but not Cl. This must mean we have a unit -SCH2CH2CH2CN. All remains is an isolated CH2 group with a large shift and the chlorine atom so they must be 1 to S."
"To alternative structures are shown for the possible products of the following reactions. Explain in each case how you would decide which product is actually formed. Several pieces of evidence could be required and estimated values are more convincing than general statements. SMILES: CC(C)(CO)C(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)[N+](=O)[O-]","In the first example, one main difference is ring size, seen mainly in the IR. Both are esters (about 1745 cm^-1) but we should add 30 cm^-1 for the five-membered ring. The functional group next to the OCH2 group is different - an OH in one and an ester in the other. In the second case, there are also differences in the IR C=O stretch between the aldehyde (about 1730 cm^-1) and the conjugated ketone (about 1680 cm^-1). The main difference is in the proton NMR. The aldehyde proton and the number of protons next to oxygen make a clear distinction. There will also be differences in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the benzene rings since one is conjugated with a C=O group and the other is not. The reaction actually gives a mixture."
"The following products might possibly be formed from the reaction of MeMgBr with the cyclic anhydride shown. How would you tell the difference between these compounds using IR and 13C NMR spectra? With 1H NMR available as well, how would your task be easier? SMILES: CC(=O)CCC(C)(C)O","The molecular formula of the compounds varies so mass spectra would also be useful, but in the IR the compounds with an OH group would show a strong broad U-shaped band at above 3000 cm^-1. The cyclic ester would have a C=O stretch at about 1775 cm^-1, the ketones a band at about 1715 cm^-1, and the CO2H group a broad band at about 1715 cm^-1 as well as a very broad V-shaped band from 2500 to 3500 cm^-1. In the 13C NMR the ester and acid would have a carbonyl group at about 170-180 p.p.m. but the ketones would have one at about 200 p.p.m. The number and position of the other signals would also vary. In the proton NMR, all compounds would show the two linked CH2 groups as a pair of triplets except in the second compound where they have the same chemical shift and do not couple."
"IR spectra of sodium fluoropyruvate in D2O are given below. Are these data compatible with the structure shown? If not, suggest how the compound might exist in this solution. δH (p.p.m.): 4.43 (2H, d, J 47 Hz); δC (p.p.m.): 83.5 (d, J 22 Hz), 86.1 (d, J 171 Hz), and =5.1 (d, J 2 Hz). SMILES: C([2H])([2H])([2H])C([2H])([2H])C([2H])([2H])C([2H])([2H])C([2H])([2H])C([2H])([2H])C([2H])([2H])C([2H])([2H])C([2H])([2H])C(=O)C(=O)C","The NMR is all right as we expect a large shift here: 1.5 + 1 (C=O) + 2 (F) = 4.5 p.p.m. measure coupling to fluorine is fine. The carbon NMR shows the carboxylate carbon at 176 p.p.m. Step shall coupling to F as it is far away and the CH2 carbon at 86.1 p.p.m. with an enormous as it is joined directly to F. But where is the ketone? We should expect it at about B. The 7 P. T. The A 8.5 p.p.m. with the expected intermediate coupling. It cannot be a carbonyl all.

"The antibiotic isolated from a microorganism crystallized from water and formed (different) crystalline salts on treatment with either acid or base. The spectroscopic data were as follows. Mass spectrum: 182 (M*, 9%), 109 (100%), 137 (87%), and 74 (15%). δH (p.p.m.; in D2O at pH < 1): 3.67 (2H, d,), 4.57 (1H, t,), 8.02 (2H, m), and 8.37 (1H, m). δC (p.p.m.; in D2O at pH < 1): 33.5, 52.8, 130.1, 130.6, 134.9, 141.3, 155.9, and 170.2. Suggest a structure for the antibiotic. SMILES: C1=CC=NC=C1","The solubility and salt formation data suggest the presence of acidic and basic groups, probably CO2H and NH2 as this is a natural compound. If so, the 13C peak at 170.2 p.p.m. is the CO2H. The five carbons in the sp2 region and protons at 8.0 and 8.4 p.p.m. suggest an aromatic ring. There cannot be just one nitrogen atom as M+ is an even number and that looks very like a pyridine ring. The two sets of aliphatic protons are coupled and the large shift of the signal at 4.57 p.p.m. suggests a proton between CO2H and NH3+. Presumably, the aliphatic part must be X or Y and that leaves just one oxygen atom for a formula of C8H10N2O3 = 182. Only six of the ten H atoms show up in the NMR because the OH, CO2F, and NH3+ protons all exchange rapidly at pH < 1 and do not show up."
"Suggest structures for the products of these two reactions. Compound 7A. m/z: 170 (M*,1%), 84 (77%), and 66 (100%); IR: 1773, 1754 cm^-1; δH (p.p.m.; CDCl3): 1.82 (6H, s) and 1.97 (4H, s). δC (p.p.m.; CDCl3): 22, 23, 28, 105, and 169 (the signals at 22 and 105 p.p.m. are weak). Compound 7B. m/z: 205 (M*, 40%), 161 (50%), 160 (35%), 106 (100%), and 77 (42%); IR: 1670, 1720 cm^-1; δH (p.p.m.; CDCl3): 2.55 (2H, m), 3.71 (1H, t, J6 Hz), 3.92 (2H, m), 7.21 (2H, d, J8 Hz), 7.35 (1H, t, J8 Hz), and 7.62 (2H, d, J8 Hz); δC (p.p.m.; CDCl3): 21, 47, 48, 121, 127, 130, 138, 170, and 172 p.p.m. SMILES: C1CC1(C(=O)O)C(=O)O","Compound 7A is much simpler. The two reagents are C5H6O4 and C5H8O2 which adds up to C10H14O6 or 230 so 60 has been lost. That looks like C2H4O2 or less likely C3H8O. If the first is right, 7A is C8H10O4 which fits the proton NMR. The IR suggests two carbonyl groups, though the 13C NMR suggests one only, but the molecule must have some symmetry as there are only five signals for eight carbon atoms. The proton NMS shows a CMe2 group and four identical protons, which can only be two identical CH2 groups. The only unsaturation is the two carbonyl groups so the 13C signal at 105 p.p.m. is very strange. Either 22 or 105 p.p.m. must be C of CMe2. The last two degrees of unsaturation must be rings. Compound 7B has nitrogen in it (odd MW) and clearly has the benzene ring too from the NMR we can put down PhN as part of the structure. It also has two carbonyl groups and they are both acid derivatives. Adding these together gives us C11H10NO2 = 188 so that is 17 missing which looks like OH. Since we need a second acid derivative and the OH is the remaining heteroatom, it must be a carboxylic acid."
"Treatment of the two compounds shown here with base gives an unknown compound with the spectra given here. What is its structure?

All the Hs in the Ph group happen to come at the same shift but those in the nitrated ring are at lower field and separated by the NO2 group."

Typically cis 3JPH is about 20 Hz and trans 3JPH is about 40 Hz. Geminal (2JPH) coupling constants are also large but more variable. In 12B there is a stereogenic centre so that the hydrogen atoms and methyl groups i.e. the ring are either on the same side as MeO or the same side as Ph. They are diastereotopic with different chemical shifts and the Hs couple (2J). We cannot say which is which."

It is unstable but can be isolated and the two 'spiro' rings sit at right angles to each other. There is again a CH group whose protons are different."
"The yellow crystalline antibiotic frustulosin was isolated from a fungus in 1975 and it was suggested that the structure was an equilibrium mixture of 14A and 14B.
