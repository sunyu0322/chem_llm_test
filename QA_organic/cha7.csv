"are these molecules conjugated? Explain your answer in any reasonable way.","The first two molecules are conjugated: the first has an enone system, the second a phenyl alkyne. The last three compounds have ester conjugation, with the first showing nitrogen lone pair delocalization. SMILES: CC(=CC(=O)C(C)(C)C=C(C)C)C, CCOC(=O)C1=CCCN(C)C1, CCOC(=O)C1CCCN(C)C1"
"Draw a full orbital diagram for all the bonding and antibonding \( \pi \) orbitals in the three-membered cyclic cation shown here. The molecule is obviously very strained. Might it survive by also being aromatic?","The cyclic cation has two π-electrons in a three-membered ring. Mixing p orbitals forms three MOs: one bonding (occupied), two degenerate antibonding. It is aromatic (4n+2 π-electrons, n=0). SMILES: [...] (long C chain invalid)"
"How extensive are the conjugated systems in these molecules?","The β-lactam shows amide and unsaturated acid conjugation. Podophyllotoxin has benzene rings, cyclic ester, and six lone pairs in conjugation. SMILES: COC1=CC(=CC(=C1OC)OC)C2C3=C(C=C4C(=C3)OCO4)C(C5COC(=O)C52)O, C1=CSC23C(C(=O)O)N4C(=O)C(C4SC2C(=O)O)N[R]"
"Draw diagrams to illustrate the conjugation present in these molecules...","Guanidinium ion shows delocalized positive charge. Enolate ion has negative charge on oxygens. Naphthalene has fully conjugated ten-electron aromatic system.

"Which of these compounds are aromatic? Justify your answer with some electron counting.","First three compounds are aromatic (6π-electrons each). Methoxatin has aromatic five-membered ring (6π) and pyridine (6π). Colchicine’s seven-membered ring has 6π-electrons. SMILES: CC1=C(C)N(C)C(=O)C(=C1C(=O)NC)N(C)C(=O)OC(C)(C)C, CC[C@@]1(CCC2=C(C3=C(C=C(C(=C3)O)O)C(=C2)O)C1=O)OC(=O)C"
"A number of water-soluble pigments...approved by the EU for use in food under E142.","The dye’s extended conjugation (N=N bonds, aromatic rings) allows visible light absorption. Sulfonate groups enhance water solubility. SMILES: CN=[N+](C)C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=C2C=CC(=[N+](C)C)C=C2)C3=C(C(=CC4=C3C=CC(=C4)S(=O)(=O)[O-])S(=O)(=O)[O-])O"
"Turn to Chapter 1...Can you see what kind of absorption leads to each colour?","Fast Green FCF uses extended conjugation with solubilizing groups. Quinoline Yellow has conjugated rings linked via OH-N. Azulene (blue) has fused 5/7 rings (10π-electrons). SMILES: CCN(CC1=CC=CC(=C1)S(=O)(=O)O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)C(=C3C=CC(=[N+](CC)CC4=CC=CC(=C4)S(=O)(=O)O)C=C3)C5=CC=C(C=C5S(=O)(=O)O)O, C1=CC2=C(C=C1)C(=O)/C(=C\3/C=CC4=C(C=CC=C4)[N-]3)/C2=N"
"Go through the list of aromatic compounds...Are all the numbers of the \( \left( {{4n} + 2}\right) \) kind?","Coumarin (6π), LSD (10π fused rings), Omeprazole (10π), Viagra (10π), and haem (18π) all follow Hückel’s rule.
