"Problem 1: Are these molecules conjugated? Explain your answer. SMILES: CC(=CC(=O)C(C)(C)C=C(C)C)C (valid), CCOC(=O)C1=CCCN(C)C1 (valid), CCOC(=O)C1=CN(C)CCC1 (valid), CCOC(=O)C1C=CCN(C)C1 (valid), CC(=O)CCC#CP (invalid)","Suggested solution: First two molecules have conjugated enone/phenyl-alkyne systems. Last three share an ester-conjugated skeleton: first has N lone pair delocalized into carbonyl, middle has alkene-ester conjugation, last only ester conjugation. Curly arrows and orbital diagrams show conjugation pathways."
"Problem 2: Draw a full orbital diagram for the three-membered cyclic cation. Is it aromatic? SMILES: C1=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CC=CCC=C (invalid)","Suggested solution: Three MOs from π/p orbital mixing: bonding (ψ1), non-bonding (ψ2), antibonding (ψ3). Two electrons occupy ψ1, meeting 4n+2 (n=0) aromaticity. Degenerate ψ2/ψ3 have antibonding interactions. Aromatic despite strain due to stabilized electron distribution."
"Problem 3: How extensive are conjugated systems in these molecules? SMILES: COC1=CC(=CC(=C1OC)OC)C2C3=C(C=C4C(=C3)OCO4)C(C5COC(=O)C52)O (podophyllotoxin), C1=CSC23C(C(=O)O)N4C(=O)C(C4SC2C(=O)O)N[R] (β-lactam)","Suggested solution: β-Lactam has amide and extended unsaturated acid conjugation. Podophyllotoxin has benzene rings, cyclic ester conjugation, and six lone pairs in extended systems. Curly arrows/diagrams show delocalization pathways across multiple rings."
"Problem 4: Draw conjugation diagrams for these molecules. SMILES: C1=CC2=C(C=C1)C=CC=C2 (naphthalene), CC(=O)C=COC (enol), C(=[NH2+])(N)N.[Cl-] (guanidinium ion)","Suggested solution: Guanidinium ion shows three resonant structures with equal N+ charges. Enolate ion has delocalized negative charge across oxygens/carbons. Naphthalene's MO diagram shows fully conjugated p-orbitals with 10 π-electrons (aromatic)."
"Problem 5: Which compounds are aromatic? SMILES: C1=CC2=C(C=C1)C3CCC2CC3 (invalid), C1=CC2=C3C=CC=C2C=C13 (invalid), O=S1(=O)O[Sb]2(=O)O[Sb]3(=O)O[Sb](=O)(O1)O[Sb](=O)(O2)O3 (invalid)","Suggested solution: First three compounds: count 6π-electrons each (aromatic). Methoxatin has aromatic 5/6-membered rings. Colchicine's seven-membered ring has 6π-electrons. Callistephin's charged ring meets Hückel rule. Aklavinone's fused rings analyzed for 4n+2 compliance."
"Problem 6: Explain the long-wavelength absorption in food dye E142. SMILES: CN=[N+](C)C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=C2C=CC(=[N+](C)C)C=C2)C3=C(C(=CC4=C3C=CC(=C4)S(=O)(=O)[O-])S(=O)(=O)[O-])O (valid)","Suggested solution: Extended conjugation across N+=N–aryl–naphthalene system lowers LUMO energy. OH group adds lone pair conjugation; sulfonate groups enhance water solubility. Symmetrical charge distribution allows low-energy n→π* transitions, shifting absorption to red/green wavelengths."
"Problem 7: Compare dye structures in shaving foam with Problem 6. SMILES: CCN(CC1=CC=CC(=C1)S(=O)(=O)O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)C(=C3C=CC(=[N+](CC)CC4=CC=CC(=C4)S(=O)(=O)O)C=C3)C5=CC=C(C=C5S(=O)(=O)O)O (Fast Green FCF)","Suggested solution: Fast Green FCF uses similar extended conjugation with solubilizing sulfonates. Quinoline Yellow has linked conjugated rings via OH→N delocalization. Spectrum compounds: azulene (10π-electrons), quinones (low LUMO), nitroso groups (n→π* transitions) explain colors."
"Problem 8: Analyze aromatic electron counts in chapter-end compounds. SMILES: C1=CC2=C(C=C1)OC(=O)C=C2 (coumarin), CC1=CC2=C3C(=C1)C4(C)C5=CC(=CN(C)[C@@]5(C)CC3=C(C)N2C(C)(C)C4=O)C(=O)N(C)C (LSD)","Suggested solution: Coumarin: 6π + 2 lone pairs = 10-electron system. LSD: fused 6π + 6π rings. Omeprazole: pyridine + fused rings (10-electrons). Viagra: 10-electron heterocycles. Haem: 18-electron macrocycle. All follow 4n+2 rule."
