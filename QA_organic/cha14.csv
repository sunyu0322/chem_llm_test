"problem 1 In the cyclization of the open-chain form of glucose to form the stable hemiacetal, it may be difficult to work out what has happened. Number the carbon atoms in the open-chain form and put the same numbers of the hemiacetal so that you can see where each carbon atom has gone. Then draw a mechanism for the reaction.<!-- Media -->`C([C@H](C(C(C(O)O)O)O)O)O.CC#CC.C([C@@H]1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O)O1)O)O)O)O.C(=O)=O.C(=O)=O.C(=O)=O`<!-- Media -->","suggested solution 1 The aldehyde (C1) attacks C5 hydroxyl via nucleophilic addition. Mechanism: C([C@H]([C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C=O)O)O)O)O)O → cyclic hemiacetal with C1-O-C5 linkage. Valid SMILES retained: [C@@H]1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H]([C@@H](O)O1)O)O)O."
"problem 2 Draw mechanisms for these reactions, which involve the loss of carbonyl oxygen.<!-- Media -->`CSN=CC1=CC=CC(=C1)F.CSN=CC1=CC=CC(=C1)F.CSC(=O)CC[NH+]=CC(=O)OC.CSN=CC1=CC=CC(=C1)F.[Cl-].[Cl-].[Cl-].[Cl-].[Cl-].[Cl-].[Mo+4]`<!-- Media -->","suggested solution 2 Methanol adds first to carbonyl, forming oxonium ion. Chloride attacks, followed by dehydration. Key SMILES: [C@H]([C@@H](C(=O)[O-])O)([NH3+])C."
"problem 3 Each of these molecules is an acetal, that is, a compound made from an aldehyde or ketone and two alcohol groups. Which compounds were used to make these acetals?<!-- Media -->`CCOC1(CCCCC1)OCC.CC1(C)CCC2(CC1)OCCO2.CC1(C)COC2(CCCC2)OC1.C1CCOC2(C1)CCCCO2`<!-- Media -->","suggested solution 3 Acetals derived from: 1) Ketone + 2 equivalents alcohol.

"problem 4 Each of these reactions leads to an acetal or a closely related compound and yet no alcohols are used in the first two reactions and no carbonyl group in the third. How are these acetals formed?<!-- Media -->`COC1(CCC2=C(C=CC=C2)C1)OC.C1=CC2=C(C=C1)CC(=O)CC2.CC(CO)(OC)OC.CC1(CC(=O)[O-])OCCO1.CC(=O)CC1OCCO1.C1C2(COC(O1)OC2)[R].C(CO)C(CO)(O)[R].CO[Si](C)(C[X17])OC.C[X1].[K+]`<!-- Media -->","suggested solution 4 Acid-catalyzed oxonium ion formation drives acetal exchange. Methanol (distilled off) and acetone byproducts shift equilibrium. Valid SMILES: CC(C)(OC)OC → CC(=O)C via oxonium intermediate."
"problem 5 Suggest mechanisms for these two reactions of the smallest aldehyde, formaldehyde (methanal, \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} = \mathrm{O} \) ).<!-- Media -->`C[C@H]1C(C)N(C)CN1C.C[C@@H](C(=NC)C)NC.C[C@@H]1CCCCN1C.C1CCNC1.C[O-].C[O-].C.C.[K+].[K+]`<!-- Media -->","suggested solution 5 Formaldehyde undergoes nucleophilic attack by amine → iminium ion. Cyclization forms five-membered ring. Valid SMILES: [C@@H]1C(C)N(C)CN1C with stereochemistry retained."
"problem 6 Suggest mechanisms for this reaction. It first appeared in Chapter 3 where we identified the rather unexpected product from its spectra but did not attempt to draw a mechanism for the reaction.<!-- Media -->`C(CBr)C1OCCO1.C=CC(=O)[O-].C(CO)O.Br.[I-].[I-]`<!-- Media -->","suggested solution 6 Conjugate addition of bromide to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, followed by acetal formation. Valid SMILES: C(CBr)C1OCCO1 → C=CC(=O)[O-] via bromide attack."
"In Chapter 6 we described how the antileprosy drug dapsone could be made soluble by the formation of a 'bisulfite adduct'. Now that you know about the reactions described in Chapter 14, you should be able to draw a mechanism for this reaction. The adduct is described as a 'pro-drug', meaning that it can give dapsone itself in the human body. How might this happen? SMILES: C1=C(C=CC(=C1)S(=O)(=O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)N)N.C1=C(C=CC(=C1)S(=O)(=O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)NCN)N","The trap is to go straight to the product by displacing hydroxide from the formaldehyde bisulfite adduct. Hydroxide is a very bad leaving group and reactions like this never occur. To avoid this trap we must use the chemistry from Chapters 6 and 14 - carbonyl chemistry. First, we must make formaldehyde from its bisulfite adduct and then add it to the amino group of dapsone. SMILES: CC(=O)[NH2+]CCC(C)(O)S(=O)(=O)[O-]. Now we can form an iminium salt and add the bisulfite back into this reactive electrophile to give the final product. SMILES: CC(=O)NCO."
"Suggest a detailed mechanism for the acetal exchange used in this chapter to make an acetal of a ketone from an orthoester. SMILES: COC1(CCOCC1)OC.COC(=O)[N-]C(=O)OC.C1COCCC1=O","The equilibrium between a ketone and an alcohol on the one hand and the dimethyl acetal on the other is unfavourable and must be driven over by devices such as this. The orthoformate is even more unstable than the acetal (three C-O bonds instead of two at the same carbon atom) and the ester even more stable, because of conjugation, than the ketone. There are various mechanisms you might have drawn, which differ only in details such as the order of the steps. The first line shows the normal mechanism for acetal formation and points out the by-product, a molecule of water. This water is consumed in the hydrolysis of the orthoformate (by an acetal hydrolysis mechanism) to give a stable ordinary ester. The favourable second equilibrium pulls the first across to the right."
"When we introduced cyclic acetals, we showed you this reaction. SMILES: COC(CC1(CCC2OCCO2)SCCCS1)OC.C1CSC(CCC2OCCO2)(CC(=O)O)SC1","What are the two functional groups not affected by this reaction? How would you hydrolyse them? This question develops immediately from the last. The noncyclic acetal hydrolyses easily because the equilibrium favours the three molecules (one aldehyde and two alcohols). The two remaining acetals are a cyclic acetal or dioxolane and a cyclic dithioacetal or dithiane. The cyclic acetal just needs more vigorous acidic conditions but the dithiane needs a Lewis acid that likes sulfur. Mercury - Hg(II) - is a good example. The precise reagents and conditions are not important."
"What would actually happen if you tried to make the unprotected Grignard reagent shown here? SMILES: CC(=O)CCCBr","The Grignard reagent would attack the carbonyl group in the same molecule or in another molecule with irreversible formation of a carbon-carbon bond. The intramolecular reaction forms a four-membered ring and so may not be favoured. There are other possibilities too such as radical reactions or polymerization."

"5 stable product can be isolated from the reaction between benzaldehyde and ammonia - discussed in this chapter. Suggest a mechanism for its formation. SMILES: C1=CC=C(C=C1)C=NC(C2=CC=CC=C2)N=CC3=CC=CC=C3","The formation of aminal follows its usual course but the imine is unstable and reacts with more benzaldehyde. The reaction with benzaldehyde starts normally enough but the dehydration of the first intermediate produces a strange looking cation with two adjacent double bonds to the same nitrogen atom."
"Suggest mechanisms for these reactions. SMILES: CC(C)(C)C1OC(=O)C(C)(C)O1.CC(=O)CC(=O)OC.CC(C)(C)C(=O)[O-].CC1=CC(=O)NN1","The first reaction starts with the usual attack of an alcohol on an aldehyde but the second nucleophile is a carboxylic acid. Though a poor nucleophile, it is good enough to react with the oxonium ion, especially when the product is cyclic. The second reaction starts with nucleophilic attack by the amine on the more electrophilic carbonyl group - the ketone. Imine formation is followed by cyclization and this second step is a normal nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group of an ester. The imine double bond moves into the ring to secure conjugation with the ester."
"Finally, don't forget the problem at the end of the chapter: suggest a mechanism for this reaction. SMILES: CCC1([2H])SCCCS1.CCC([2H])=O.C(CS)CS","The mechanism is a direct analogue of acetal formation. The dehydration step is more difficult because the C=S bond is less stable than the C=O bond because overlap of 2p and 3p orbitals is not as good as overlap of orbitals (for example, two 2ps) of the same size and energy."
