"Draw mechanisms for these reactions.","Draw out the \( {\mathrm{{BH}}}_{4} \) or \( {\mathrm{{AlH}}}_{4} \) anion, and the compound if necessary, and transfer the hydride ion. A second protonation step is also needed - during the work-up in the second case. It is not necessary to draw out the whole metal hydride anion but you must draw out one metal-hydrogen bond as you need to take electrons from that bond. SMILES: C1CCC(C1)CO, [Ag](O)O, C1CC(=O)C1"
"Cyclopropanone exists as the hydrate in water but 2-hydroxyethanal does not exist as its hemiacetal. Explain.","Hydration is an equilibrium reaction. Cyclopropanone's trigonal \( \mathrm{{sp}}^2 \) carbon (strained at \( 60^\circ \)) becomes tetrahedral \( \mathrm{{sp}}^3 \) in the hydrate (reducing strain). 2-Hydroxyethanal's hemiacetal has \( 49^\circ \) strain at each corner and is less stable. SMILES: C1CC1(O)O, C1CC1=O"
"One way to make cyanohydrins is illustrated here. Suggest a detailed mechanism for the process.","The silyl cyanide acts as an electrophile, while cyanide ion is a nucleophile. Cyanide adds to the carbonyl group, and the oxyanion is captured by silicon, regenerating cyanide. SMILES: C[Si](C)(C)OC(C#N)([R19a])[R19a]"
"There are three possible products from the reduction of this compound with sodium borohydride. What are their structures? How would you distinguish them spectroscopically?","Products: hydroxy-ketone (CC(C1=CC=C(CCCO)C=C1)O), hydroxy-aldehyde, and diol. Distinguish via IR (1680 vs. 1730 cm⁻¹ for conjugated/non-conjugated C=O) and ¹³C NMR (80 vs. 60 ppm for hydroxy-ketone/aldehyde). SMILES: CC(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)CCC([3H])=O"
"The triketone shown here is called 'ninhydrin' and is used for the detection of amino acids. It exists in aqueous solution as a monohydrate. Which of the three ketones is hydrated and why?","The central carbonyl hydrates due to destabilization from adjacent ketones. The two ring-adjacent ketones are stabilized by conjugation with the benzene ring. SMILES: C1=CC2=C(C=C1)C(=O)C(C2=O)(O)O"
"This hydroxy-ketone shows no peaks in its infrared spectrum between 1600 and \( 1800 \mathrm{\;{cm}}^{-1} \) but does show a broad absorption at 3000 to \( 3400 \mathrm{\;{cm}}^{-1} \). Explain.","The compound exists as a cyclic hemiacetal, eliminating the carbonyl group. The 110 ppm ¹³C NMR peak corresponds to a saturated carbon adjacent to two oxygens. SMILES: CC1(C)CC(C)(OC1)[O-]"
"Each of these compounds is a hemiacetal. Give the structure of the original alcohol and carbonyl compound.","Break bonds between oxygen atoms to identify components. Example: C1CCC(CC1)OC2(CCCCC2)O → alcohol (cyclohexanol) + ketone (cyclohexanone). SMILES: C1CCC(CC1)O, C1CCC(=O)CC1"
"Trichloroethanol may be prepared by the direct reduction of chloral hydrate with sodium borohydride. Suggest a mechanism.","Chloral hydrate (C(Cl)₃C(OH)₂) equilibrates with chloral (C(Cl)₃CHO). NaBH₄ reduces the carbonyl group, yielding trichloroethanol. SMILES: C(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)Cl, C(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)CO"
"It has not been possible to prepare the adducts from simple aldehydes and HCl. Explain.","The adduct (RCH(OH)Cl) decomposes due to chloride ion stability, reversing the equilibrium. SMILES: C(OC(Cl)([R])[R])[R]"
"What would be the products of these reactions? Give mechanisms.","1) Cyanohydrin formation: C=C(C)CCC(C#N)(O)[R]. 2) Grignard addition: CCC(C)(C)O. 3) NaBH₄ reduces ketone but not ester: C1CC(=O)OCCC1=O. SMILES: C=C(C)CCC(C#N)(O)[R], CCC(C)(C)O, C1CC(=O)OCCC1=O"
"The equilibrium constant \( K_{\mathrm{eq}} \) for formation of the cyanohydrin of cyclopentanone and HCN is 67, while for butan-2-one it is 28. Explain.","Cyclopentanone’s ring strain (108° vs. ideal 120°) is relieved upon hydration (tetrahedral geometry, 109°), favoring hydration more than butan-2-one. SMILES: C1CCC(C1)OC(N=C=NC2(CCC(CC2)(O)O)O)[X16]"
