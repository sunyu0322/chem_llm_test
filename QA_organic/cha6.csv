"Problem 1: Draw mechanisms for these reactions. SMILES: C1CCC(C1)CO (cyclopentanol), C1CC(=O)C1 (cyclopropanone), [Ag](O)O (silver oxide)","Suggested solution: Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) or aluminum hydride (AlH₄⁻) anions act as hydride donors. The mechanism involves hydride transfer to the carbonyl carbon, followed by protonation during workup. Silver oxide facilitates the reduction by activating the carbonyl group."
"Problem 2: Why does cyclopropanone exist as a hydrate in water, but 2-hydroxyethanal does not form a hemiacetal? SMILES: C1CC1(O)O (cyclopropanone hydrate), C(C(=O)[O-])O (2-hydroxyethanal)","Suggested solution: Cyclopropanone hydrate is stabilized by relieving ring strain (60° → 109° angles). Hemiacetals are less stable than carbonyl compounds due to weaker C–O bonds. 2-Hydroxyethanal's hemiacetal has additional ring strain (49° angles), making it unfavorable."
"Problem 3: Mechanism for cyanohydrin formation using silyl cyanide. SMILES: C[Si](C)(C)OC(C#N)([R19a])[R19a] (silyl cyanide), C(=O)([3H])[R19a] (carbonyl compound)","Suggested solution: Silyl cyanide acts as an electrophile. Cyanide ion adds to the carbonyl, forming an oxyanion that is captured by silicon, regenerating cyanide for catalytic turnover."
"Problem 4: Three possible products from reduction of CC(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)CCC([3H])=O. How to distinguish them spectroscopically? SMILES: CC(C1=CC=C(CCCO)C=C1)O (hydroxy-ketone), CC(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)CCCO (hydroxy-aldehyde), CC(C1=CC=C(CCCO)C=C1)O (diol)","Suggested solution: Diol lacks C=O (no IR 1600–1800 cm⁻¹; ¹³C NMR <150 ppm). Hydroxy-ketone shows conjugated C=O (IR ~1680 cm⁻¹; ¹³C ~80 ppm). Hydroxy-aldehyde has non-conjugated C=O (IR ~1730 cm⁻¹; ¹³C ~60 ppm). Mass spectra differ due to α-cleavage fragments."
"Problem 5: Which ketone in ninhydrin hydrates, and why? SMILES: C1=CC2=C(C=C1)C(=O)C(C2=O)(O)O (ninhydrin hydrate)","Suggested solution: The central ketone hydrates due to destabilization by adjacent carbonyl groups. Peripheral ketones are stabilized by conjugation with the benzene ring."
"Problem 6: Explain IR and ¹³C NMR data for CC(=O)CC(C)(C)CO. SMILES: CC(=O)CC(C)(C)CO (hydroxy-ketone)","Suggested solution: The compound exists as a cyclic hemiacetal, eliminating the carbonyl group (no IR 1600–1800 cm⁻¹). The ¹³C peak at 110 ppm corresponds to a hemiacetal carbon adjacent to two oxygen atoms."
"Problem 7: Identify carbonyl and alcohol components for hemiacetals. SMILES: C1CCC(CC1)OC2(CCCCC2)O (cyclohexyl hemiacetal), CC(O)OCCCOC(C)O (diethylene glycol hemiacetal)","Suggested solution: Break bonds between oxygen atoms to reveal original alcohols and carbonyl compounds. Example: cyclohexanol + cyclohexanone → C1CCC(CC1)OC2(CCCCC2)O."
"Problem 8: Mechanism for trichloroethanol synthesis from chloral hydrate. SMILES: C(C(Cl)(Cl)Cl)(O)(O)O (chloral hydrate), C(C(Cl)(Cl)Cl)(Cl)(Cl)Cl (trichloroethanol)","Suggested solution: Chloral hydrate equilibrates with its carbonyl form. NaBH₄ reduces the carbonyl group, retaining chlorine atoms. Hydrate formation is reversible, allowing reduction."
"Problem 9: Why can’t simple aldehyde-HCl adducts be isolated? SMILES: C(OC(Cl)([R])[R])[R] (hypothetical adduct)","Suggested solution: Adducts decompose via retro-addition due to chloride ion stability. Hemiacetals are inherently unstable, favoring carbonyl regeneration over adduct formation."
"Problem 10: Predict products for cyanohydrin, Grignard, and NaBH₄ reactions. SMILES: C=C(C)CCO (aldehyde), C1CC(=O)OCCC1=O (cyclic keto-ester)","Suggested solution: Cyanohydrin forms via cyanide addition. Grignard reagent adds to carbonyl. NaBH₄ reduces ketones but not esters. Ester remains in cyclic keto-ester reduction."
"Problem 11: Why is K_eq higher for cyclopentanone cyanohydrin than butan-2-one? SMILES: C1CCC(C1)OC(N=C=NC2(CCC(CC2)(O)O)O)[X16] (cyclopentanone cyanohydrin), CCC(=O)C[X16]([H])([H])[X15]([H])([H])CCC(C)(O)O (butan-2-one cyanohydrin)","Suggested solution: Cyclopentanone hydrate relieves ring strain (108° → 109° angles), stabilizing the tetrahedral center. Butan-2-one lacks this strain relief, leading to lower K_eq (28 vs. 67)."
