"## Problem 1\nDraw mechanisms for this reaction and explain why this particular product is formed.\n<!-- Media -->\n`COS(=O)(=O)CCSCCS(=O)(=O)OC.C=CS(=O)(=O)OC.CCO.CO[SiH3]`","## Suggested solution\nThe first step must be a conjugate addition but will it be \( {\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{\;S} \) or the \( {\mathrm{{HS}}}^{ - } \) anion that does the job? The base present is \( \mathrm{{NaOAc}}\left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}}\right. \) about 5 ) while \( {\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{\;S} \) has a \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) of 7.0 so that very little of it is ionized. We should use neutral \( {\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{\;S} \) .\n<!-- Media -->\n`CC(CCCC[SiH3])(OC)OC.CO[C@@H](/C(=C(/CS(=O)(=O)N=[N+]=[N-])\[R11])/OC)[Y19].COS(=O)(=O)CC[Si](C)(C)C`"
"## Problem 3\nSegest reasons for the different outcomes of the following reactions (your answer must, of Then include a mechanism for each reaction).\n<!-- Media -->\n`CC(=O)CC(C)(C)N.CC(=CC(C)O)C.CC(=CC(=O)C)C.CC.CC.CC.CN.COS(=O)(=O)O.O`","## Suggested solution\nThe Michael acceptor is a conjugated ketone that is able to do either direct or conjugate addition. \( 1 - x \) ines are softer nucleophiles able to add reversibly and more likely to give conjugate addition by thermodynamic control. \( {\mathrm{{LiAlH}}}_{4} \) is very hard and completely irreversible so it gives direct addition - kinetic control. If you drew a full mechanism for each reaction, your answer is better than 2023."
"## Problem 4\nAddition of dimethylamine to the unsaturated ester A could give either product B or C. Draw mechanisms for both reactions and show how you would distinguish them spectroscopically.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C=C(CN(C)C)C(=O)OC.C=C(C)C(=O)N([2H])N(C)C.C=C(C)C(=O)OC.CN(C)N[2H].CN(C)N[2H].[U].[U]`","## Suggested solution\nThe mechanisms are standard and this is an enone that really might do either. Product B is the result of direct addition followed by loss of a leaving group - a likely reaction as amines attack saturated esters in this way. This reaction is fully treated in Chapter 12.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C=C(C)C(CCN(C)C)(N(C)C)OC.C=C(C)C(N(C)C)(N(C)C)OC.C=C(C)C(CCN(C)C)(N(C)C)OC.[H][H].[H][H]`"

Even the weakly nucleophilic acetate ion will react as the nitro-stabilized anion is very stable indeed.\n<!-- Media -->\n`CC(=O)OCC(COC(=O)C)(N1CCOCC1)[R12]([H])([H])OC(=O)C.CC(=O)OCCOC(=O)C.CC(=O)OCCO[R13](=O)C`"

The key difference is in the metal. With \( \mathrm{{Cu}}\left( \mathrm{I}\right) \) as catalyst,the Grignard reagent will give conjugate addition in the first example but MeLi will give direct addition in the second."

"## Problem 9\nHow might this compound be made using a conjugate addition as one of the steps? You might find it helpful to consider the preparation of tertiary alcohols as described in Chapter 9 and also to refer back to Problem 1 in this chapter.\n<!-- Media -->\n`CC(C)(CCN(CCC(C)(C)O)NC)O`","## Suggested solution\nWe need carbonyl groups to do conjugate addition so the tertiary alcohols will have to be made from them. In Chapter 9 (p. 222) we saw how to make such tertiary alcohols from esters and organometallic compounds and in Problem 1 of this set we saw how to do double conjugate additions on unsaturated esters - all the pieces fit together.\n<!-- Media -->\n`CC(C)(CCN(CCC(C)(C)O)S(=O)(=O)C)O.CN(CCS(=O)(=O)F)CCS(=O)(=O)F.C=CS(=O)(=O)F.CN(C)S(=O)(=O)F.CN(C)S(=O)(=O)F`"
"## Problem 10\nAhen we discussed reduction of cyclopentenone to cyclopentanol, we suggested that ::!

"## Problem 11\nSuggest a mechanism for this reaction. Why does conjugate addition occur rather than direct addition? Why is the product shown as a cation?

On balance, conjugate addition wins. The intermediate enolate is trapped by silicon - an excellent electrophile for oxygen. The product is indeed a cation. The nucleophile was neutral and has lost electrons in the addition step. The counterion is chloride as all the atoms in the reagents are incorporated into the product.\n<!-- Media -->\n`C[Si](C)(C)CC12CCCC(CC1)(C2)C[Si](C)(C)Cl.[Cl-].[Ti+2]`"
