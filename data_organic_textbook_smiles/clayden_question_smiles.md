## Suggested solutions for Chapter 2

## Problem 1

Draw good diagrams of saturated hydrocarbons with seven carbon atoms having (a) mean, (b) branched, and (c) tycks frameworks. Draw molecules based on each framework having both ketone and carboxylic adic functional groups.

## Purpose of the problem

To get you drawing simple structures well and to steer you away from rules and names towards creative structural ideas.

## Suggested solution

There is only one linear saturated hydrocarbon with seven carbon atoms but there is a wide choice for the rest. We offer some possibilities but you may well have thought of others.

We give just a few examples for the ketones and carboxylic acids. You will notice that no Cr carbocyclic acid is possible based on, say, cycloheptane without adding an extra carbon atom.

Study the structure of brevelosis on a. 33. Make a list of the different types of functional group (you already know that there are many effect and of the numbers of range of different states. Finally, study the carbon framework - is in linear, cyclic, or branched?

## Purpose of the problem

To persuade you that functional groups are easily recognized even in complicated molecules and that, say, an ester is an ester whatever company it may keep. You were not expected to see the full implications of the carbon framework part of the question. That was to amuse and surprise you.

## Suggested solution

The ethers are all the unmarked oxygen atoms in the rings: all are cyclic, seven in six-membered rings, two in seven-membered rings, and one in an eight-membered ring. There are two carbonyl groups, one an ester and one an aldehyde, and three alkenes.

The carbon chain is branched because it has seven methyl groups branching off it and the aldehyde is also a branch. Amazingly, under this disguise, you can detect a basically linear carbon chain, shown with a thick black line, although it twists and turns throughout the entire molecule!

## Purpose of the problem

To shock you with two dreadful structures and to try and convince you that well drawn realistic structures are more attractive to the eye as well as easier to understand.

## Suggested solution

The bond angles are grotesque with square planar saturated carbon,alkynes at \( {120}^{ \circ  } \) ,alkenes at \( {180}^{ \circ  } \) , bonds coming off benzene rings at the wrong angle, and so on. The left-hand structure would be clearer if most of the hydrogens were omitted. Here are two possible better structures for each molecule. There are many other correct possibilities.

## Problem 4

Draw structures corresponding to these names. In each case suggest alternative names that might convey the structure more clearly to someone who is listening to you speak.

(a) 1,4-di-(1,1-dimethylethyl)benzene

(b) 3-(prop-2-enyloxy)prop-1-ene

(c) cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene

## Purpose of the problem

To help you appreciate the limitations of names, the usefulness of names for part structures, and, in the case of (c), to amuse.

## Suggested solution

(a) 1,4-di-(1,1-dimethylethyl)benzene. More helpful name para-di-t-butyl benzene. It is sold as 1,4-di-tert-butyl benzene, an equally helpful name.

(b) 3-( prop-2-enyloxy)prop-1-ene. This name does not convey the simple symmetrical structure nor that it contains two allyl groups. Most chemists would call this 'diallyl ether' though it is sold as 'allyl ether'.

(c) cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene. This is, of course, benzene, but even IUPAC has not tried to impose this 'correct' name for such an important compound.

## Purpose of the problem

D

To help you appreciate the wide range and versatility of general structures with \( \mathrm{X},{\mathrm{R}}^{1},{\mathrm{{Ar}}}^{1} \) ,etc. These become more important when you start a database search for a part structure.

## Suggested solution

There are,of course,many possible solutions. \( \mathrm{X} \) could be a heteroatom or a structural fragment while Ar could be any of a very large number of substituted benzene rings or even other types of aromatic rings. Our first two solutions in each case are ones you might have found and the rest are more inventive. The four-membered ring could have \( \mathrm{X} = \mathrm{{NH}} \) or \( \mathrm{{CO}} \) (a ketone) while the substituents \( {\mathrm{R}}^{1} \) and \( {\mathrm{R}}^{2} \) could be the same (both methyl groups) or different (a benzene ring and an ether). In the last two structures \( \mathrm{X} \) itself carries extra groups - the two oxygen atoms in the \( {\mathrm{{SO}}}_{2} \) group or an alkene - while \( {\mathrm{R}}^{1} \) and \( {\mathrm{R}}^{2} \) could be in a ring or be different highly functionalized groups. Of course,there are also some things that \( {\mathrm{R}}^{1},{\mathrm{R}}^{2} \) ,and \( \mathrm{X} \) cannot be. \( {\mathrm{R}}^{1} \) and \( {\mathrm{R}}^{2} \) cannot be \( \mathrm{N} \) or \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) while \( \mathrm{X} \) cannot be \( \mathrm{{Ph}} \) or \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) .

Translate these very poor 'diagrams' of molecules into more realistic structures. Try to get the angles about right and, whatever you do. don't include any square planar carbon atoms or other bond angles of \( {90}^{ \circ  } \) !

## Purpose of the problem

An exercise in interpretation and composition - this sort of 'structure', which is used when structures must be represented by ordinary printing, gives no clue to the shape of the molecule and you must decide that for yourself.

## Suggested solution

You probably needed a few trial and error drawings first, but simply drawing out the carbon chains gives you the answers. The first is straightforward though you may not previously have seen the dot on the middle of the formula. This does not represent any atom but simply shows that the atom immediately before the dot is not joined to that immediately after it. The(OH)group is a substituent off the chain, not part of the chain itself. The second has no ends (Me groups, etc.) and so must be an unbroken ring. The third gives no clue as to the shape of the alkene and we have chosen trans. It also uses two ways to represent MeO. Either is correct but it is best to stick to one representation in any given molecule.

## Problem 7

Suggest at least six different structures that would fit the formula \( {\mathrm{C}}_{4}{\mathrm{H}}_{7}\mathrm{{NO}} \) . Make good realistic diagrams of each one and say which functional group(s) are present.

## Purpose of the problem

The identification and naming of functional groups is more important than the naming of compounds. This was your chance to experiment with different functional groups as well as Efferent carbon skeletons.

\[\text{off said.htmls/[1] 23.}\]

## Suggested solution

You will have found the carbonyl and amino groups very useful, but did you also use alkenes and alaynes, rings, ethers, alcohols, and cyanides? Here are twelve possibilities but there are many more. The functional group names in brackets are alternatives: some you will not have known. You need So, have classified the alcohols and amines.

## Problem 8

Draw and name a structure corresponding to each of these data.

(a) An aromatic compound containing one benzene ring with the tilting substituents: two chlorine atoms having a para relationship, a nitro group represents the data onship to one of the chlorine atoms, and an acetyl group having a respective nitro group.

(b) An alkyne having a trifluoromethyl substituent \( \Xi \) : the arc arc a chain of three carbon atoms at the other with a hydroxyl group \( {2}^{-n} \) times are amino group on the second, and the third being a carboxyl group.

## Purpose of the problem

Just a little practice in converting verbal descriptions into them naming them is justified. We hope you agree that the diagrams are more description in the question and more easily understood than the name.

## Suggested solution

The structures are uniquely described by the rather verbose concern

Naming the compounds requires (1) identifying the boss group, (2) numbering the skeleton, and (3) locating the functional group by name - The aromatic compound is a ketone with two carbon atoms - an ethanone (even they are cannot be a two-carbon ketone!). The carbonyl group is \( \mathrm{C}1 \) . The aromatic ring is load on by its \( \mathrm{C}1 \) at \( \mathrm{C}1 \) and is numbered so as to give the smallest possible numbers to the (2,5-dichloro-3- nitrophenyl)ethanone.

The aliphatic compound is a carboxylic acid which CI. The rest is straightforward. Groups are usually named in alphabetical order. It is 2- 6-trifluorohex-4-ynoic acid. If you don't agree with our names, don't worry. It does matter. What does matter is: did you draw clear comprehensible structures?

## Problem 9

Draw full structures for these compounds, displaying the "yotoceton framework clearly and showing all the bonds present in the functional groups. We the the functional groups. \( \mathrm{{AcO}}{\left( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\right) }_{3}{\mathrm{{NO}}}_{2} \) \( {\mathrm{{MeO}}}_{2}\mathrm{C}.{\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) . OCOEt \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} = \mathrm{{CH}}.\mathrm{{CO}}.\mathrm{{NH}}{\left( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\right) }_{2}\mathrm{{CN}} \)

## Purpose of the problem

This is rather like Problem 6 except that more thought is needed for the details of the functional groups and you may have needed to check the 'organic dens' Ac, Et, and so on in the chapter.

## Suggested solution

For once the solution can be simply stated as no variation is really possible The tricks for the first one are to see that ’ \( \mathrm{{AcO}} \) ’ represents an ester and to have only four bonds to nitrogen in \( {\mathrm{{NO}}}_{2} \) . The second has two ester groups on the central \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) group but one is joined to it by a \( \mathrm{{CO}} \) bond and the

coder by a CC bond. The last is straightforward except for the dots used to separate the substituents arlained in the answer to Problem 6). Problem 10

## Purpose of the problem

This important exercise is one you will get used to very quickly and, before long, do without mining. If you do, it will save you from many trivial errors. Remember that the oxidation state of carbon is +4 , or C(IV), in all these compounds. The oxidation level of a functional group tells you with which oxygen-based functional group it is interchangeable without oxidation or reduction.

## Suggested solution

assets the number of bonds to heteroatoms. These can range from none to four. The only tricky as are alkenes and alkynes, which have no heteroatoms but are formed by dehydration of Ecohols, aldehydes, or ketones. There is a summary chart on p. 36 of the textbook, but briefly:

## Suggested solutions for Chapter 3

## Problem 1

How does the mass spectrum gives evidence of isotopes in the compounds of bromine, onlorine, and carbon? Assuming the molecular ion of each of these compounds is of 100% abundance, what peaks (and in what intensity) would appear around that mass number? (a) \( {\mathrm{C}}_{5}{\mathrm{H}}_{5}\mathrm{{BrO}} \) ,(b) \( {\mathrm{C}}_{60} \) ,(c) \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{4}\mathrm{{BrCl}} \) ? Give in cases (a) and (c) a possible structure for the compound. What compound is (b)?

## Purpose of the problem

To give you practice in spotting the important atoms that have isotopes and in interpreting multiple molecular ions. The molecular ion is the most important peak in the mass spectrum and is often the acty peak to interest us.

## Suggested solution

Bromine has two isotopes, \( {}^{79}\mathrm{{Br}} \) and \( {}^{81}\mathrm{{Br}} \) ,in about a 1:1 ratio,chlorine has two, \( {}^{35}\mathrm{{Cl}} \) and \( {}^{37}\mathrm{{Cl}} \) ,in about a 3:1 ratio and there is about \( {1.1}\% {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) in normal compounds. Hence the molecular ions of \( \rightarrow \) three compounds will be as follows.

a’ \( {\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{5}\mathrm{{BrO}} \) ,MW 124/126. There will also be weak peaks (2.2% of each main peak) at 125 and 127 for the same ions with \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) .

---

- Compounds containing \( \mathrm{{Br}} \) or \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) should have their molecular ions specified like this. The first figure gives \( {\mathrm{M}}^{ + } \) with \( {}^{79}\mathrm{{Br}} \) and the second with \( {}^{81}\mathrm{{Br}} \) .

---

b: \( {\mathrm{C}}_{60} \) has a molecular ion at 720 with a strong peak at 721 . The chance that one \( \mathrm{C} \) atom is \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) is simply \( {60} \times  {1.1}\%  = {66}\% \) so the \( \mathrm{M} + 1 \) peak is more than half as strong as \( {\mathrm{M}}^{ + } \) itself. The chance of two \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) atoms is small.

c) \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{4}\mathrm{{BrCl}} \) is more complicated as the molecular ion will contain a 1:1 ratio of \( {}^{79}\mathrm{{Br}} \) and \( {}^{81}\mathrm{{Br}} \) ,and a 3:1 ratio of \( {}^{35}\mathrm{{Cl}} \) and \( {}^{37}\mathrm{{Cl}} \) . The molecular ion consists of four peaks (ratios in brackets): \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{4}^{79}{\mathrm{{Br}}}^{35}\mathrm{{Cl}} \) (3), \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{4}^{81}{\mathrm{{Br}}}^{35}\mathrm{{Cl}} \) (3), \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{4}^{79}{\mathrm{{Br}}}^{37}\mathrm{{Cl}} \) (1),and \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{4}^{81}{\mathrm{{Br}}}^{37}\mathrm{{Cl}} \) (1). The masses of these peaks are 190, 192, 192, and 194. The molecular ion will therefore have three peaks at 190, 192, and 194 in a ratio of 3:4:1 with peaks at 191,193,and 195 at \( 6 \times  {1.1}\%  = {6.6}\% \) of the peak before it. So the complete picture is 190 (75%), 191 (5%), 192 (100%), 193 (6.6%), 194 (25%), and 195 (1.7%).

Compound (b) is, of course, buckminsterfullerene and the other compounds might be isomers such as these.

## Purpose of the problem

To familiarize you with the four main regions of the \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR spectrum: saturated carbons at 0-50 p.p.m., saturated carbons next to oxygen at 50-100 p.p.m., alkenes and aromatic compounds with unsaturated carbon at \( {100} - {150} \) p.p.m.,and unsaturated carbon next to oxygen (usually \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) ) at \( {150} - {200} \) p.p.m.

There are four different types of carbon atom in the benzene ring (don't forget the 'ipso' carbon joined to the substituent) and it is not easy to say which is which. The rest can be deduced from the four main regions.

## Problem 3

The thinner used in typists’ correction fluids is a single compound, \( {\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{3}{\mathrm{{Cl}}}_{3} \) ,having \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR peaks at 45.1 and 95.0 p.p.m. What is its structure? A commercial paint thinner gives two spots on chromatography and has \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR peaks at 7.0,27.5,35.2,45.3,95.6,and 206.3 p.p.m. Suggest what compounds might be used to make up this thinner.

## Purpose of the problem

To start you on the road of structure identification with one very simple problem and then some deductive reasoning. It is necessary to think about the size of chemical shifts in this case.

## Suggested solution

There are only two possible structures for a compound \( {\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{3}{\mathrm{{Cl}}}_{3} \) - it must be trichloroethane and the chlorines can be distributed in these two ways.

<!-- Media -->

---

- We have ignored the effects of the \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) atoms on the other \( \mathrm{C} \) atom, but they will also increase the chemical shift to a lesser extent.

---

The first isomer would have a peak for the methyl group in the region 0-50 p.p.m. and one for the \( {\mathrm{{CCl}}}_{3} \) group at a much larger chemical shift because of the three chlorine atoms. The second isomer would have a peak for \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Cl}} \) in the \( {50} - {100} \) p.p.m. region and one for \( {\mathrm{{CHCl}}}_{2} \) at a larger shift but the two shifts would not be so far apart. The observed shifts are 50 p.p.m. apart and, in fact, the compound is 1,1,1-trichloroethane. The NMR spectrum of the 1,1,2-trichloro isomer has peaks at 50.5 and 70.7 p.p.m. - much closer together.

206.3 7.3

<!-- Media -->

The mixture probably contains the same trichloroethane as the peaks at 45.3 and 95.6 p.p.m. suggest (the chemical shifts of the mixture need not be quite the same as those of the pure compound as each compound is effectively dissolved in the other). The remaining peaks at 7.0, 27.3, 35.2, and 206.3 p.p.m. definitely belong to a carbonyl compound, probably a ketone since 206.3 p.p.m. is so large. Butanone fits the bill as it has one methyl and one \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) group on the carbonyl group and one methyl away from any electronegative atoms. There are other possibilities.

## Problem 4

The ’normal’ O-H stretch (i.e. without hydrogen bonding) comes at about \( {3600}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) . What is the reduced mass \( \left( \mu \right) \) for \( \mathrm{O} - \mathrm{H} \) ? What happens to the reduced mass when you double the atomic weight of each atom in turn,that is,what is \( \mu \) for \( \mathrm{O} - \mathrm{D} \) and what is \( \mu \) for \( \mathrm{S} - \mathrm{H} \) ? In fact, both \( \mathrm{O} - \mathrm{D} \) and \( \mathrm{S} - \mathrm{H} \) stretches come at about \( {2500}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) . Why?

## Purpose of the problem

To get you thinking about the position of IR bands in terms of the two main influences - reduced mass and bond strength. The relationship between the frequency(v)of the vibration,

the force constant \( f \) (more or less equals bond strength),and the reduced mass \( \left( \mu \right) \) is given by mes equation.

\[v = \frac{1}{2\pi c}\sqrt{\frac{f}{\mu }}\]

## Suggested solution

The reduced mass \( \left( \mu \right) \) of a vibrating bond is given by this equation.

\[\mu  = \frac{{m}_{1}{m}_{2}}{{m}_{1} + {m}_{2}}\]

Sc She reduced mass of \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) is \( {16}/{17} \) or about 0.94 . When you double the mass of \( \mathrm{H} \) ,the reduced mass of OD becomes \( {32}/{18} \) or about 1.78 which is roughly double that for OH. But when you simple the mass of \( \mathrm{O} \) ,the reduced mass for \( \mathrm{{SH}} \) is \( {32}/{33} \) or about0.97- hardly changed from \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) ! The change in reduced mass is enough to account for the changed frequency of the OD bond - it showers by about \( \sqrt{2} \) - but cannot account for the change from \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) to \( \mathrm{{SH}} \) as the two reduced ames are about the same. The only explanation of this can be that the \( \mathrm{{SH}} \) bond is weaker than the CH bond by a factor of about 2.

There is an important principle to be deduced from this problem. Very roughly, the reduced masses of all bonds involving heavier atoms (C, N, O, S, etc.) are about the same and the differences in IR mething frequency are mostly due to changes in bond strength. This is most dramatic in comparing Jule, double, and triple bonds. Only with bonds involving hydrogen does the reduced mass become the more important factor, though it is also significant in comparing, say, C-O with C-Cl.

## Problem 5

"ree compounds,each having the formula \( {\mathrm{C}}_{3}{\mathrm{H}}_{5}\mathrm{{NO}} \) ,have the IR spectra summarized here. At are their structures? Without \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR data,it may be easier to tackle this problem by That writing down all the possible structures for \( {\mathrm{C}}_{3}{\mathrm{H}}_{5}\mathrm{{NO}} \) . In what specific ways would \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) WIR data help?

3 One sharp band above \( {3000}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) ; one strong band at about \( {1700}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \)

- Two sharp bands above \( {3000}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) ; two bands between 1600 and \( {1700}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \)

: One strong broad band above \( {3000}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) ; a band at about \( {2200}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \)

## Purpose of the problem

- that IR alone has some usefulness in the identification of molecules but that NMR is recessary even with very simple molecules. In answers to examination questions of this type it is Sect. to show how you interpret the data as well as to give a structure. If you get the answer right, me - rerpretation is not so important, but, if you get the answer wrong, you should still get some - for your interpretation.

## seggested solution

1 Here sharp band above \( {3000}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) must be an \( \mathrm{N} - \mathrm{H} \) and one strong band at about \( {1700}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) is probably a \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) . That leaves \( {\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{4} \) and so we might have one of these (there are other less likely structures). \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR would help because a(i) would have a carbonyl group and two signals for sturated \( \mathrm{C} \) while a(ii) would also have a \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) but only one signal for saturated carbon as the compound is symmetrical.

This leaves just three hydrogen atoms and gives us structures such as b(i) or b(ii). \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR would help because the \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) shift would show whether the compound was an amide or an aldehyde and the alkene shifts would reveal the presence of the \( {\mathrm{{NH}}}_{2} \) group in \( \mathrm{b}\left( \mathrm{{ii}}\right) \) .

## Problem 6

Four compounds having the molecular formula \( {\mathrm{C}}_{4}{\mathrm{H}}_{6}{\mathrm{O}}_{2} \) have the IR and \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR spectra given below. How many DBEs (Double Bond Equivalents) are there in \( {\mathrm{C}}_{4}{\mathrm{H}}_{6}{\mathrm{O}}_{2} \) ? What are the structures of the four compounds? You might again find it helpful to draw out some or all possibilities before you start.

(a) IR: \( {1745}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) ; \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR:214,82,58,and41p.p.m.

(b) IR: 3300 (broad) cm \( {}^{-1} \) : \( {}^{13} \) C NMR: 62 and 79 p.p.m.

(c) IR: \( {1770}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) ; "C NMR: 178,86.40,and 27 p.p.m.

(d) IR: 1720 and 1650 (strong) cm \( {}^{1} \) ; 1°C NMR: 165,131,133, and 54 p.p.m.

## Purpose of the problem

First steps in real identification using two different methods. Because the molecules are so small (only four carbon atoms) drawing out a few trial structures gives you some ideas as to the types of compounds likely to be found.

## Suggested solution

Here are some possible structures for \( {\mathrm{C}}_{1}{\mathrm{H}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{2} \) . It is clear that two double bonds or one double bond and a ring are likely to feature. The double bonds have got to be \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{C} \) or \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{C} \) (or both if there is no ring). Functional groups are likely to include alcohol, aldehyde, acid, and ketone.

(a) IR: \( {1745}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) must be a C=0 group; \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR: 214 p.p.m. taldehyde or ketone), 82 and 58 p.p.m. (two saturated carbons next to oxygen?), and 41 p.p.m. (one saturated carbon not next to oxygen but near some electron-withdrawing group). The second oxygen does not show up in the IR so it must be an ether. As there is only one double bond, there must be a ring. This suggests one structure.

(b) IR: 3300 (broad) cm \( {}^{1} \) must be an OH; \( {}^{13} \) C NMR: 62 and 79 g.p.m. must be a symmetrical molecule with no alkenes and no \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) so it must be a triple bond \( {\mathrm{L}}^{ + }\mathrm{N} - \mathrm{S}\left( {\mathrm{O},\mathrm{P},\mathrm{N} - \mathrm{S}0\text{p.p.m.}}\right) \) and a saturated carbon next to oxygen. This again gives one structure. Not, that the alkyne does not show up in the IR because it is symmetrical.

(c) IR: \( {1770}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) must be some sort of \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O};{}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR: 178 p.p.m. (C=O of acid derivative),86 p.p.m. (saturated C next to O), 40 and 27 p.p.m. (saturated Cs not next to O). Again only one double bond so it must have a ring too. Looks like a close relative of (a)!

This defines all the carbon atoms and it must be a simple unsaturated ester. Notice that we cannot tell which signal corresponds to which alkene carbon but that this does not affect our conclusion.

## Problem 7

Three compounds of molecular formula \( {\mathrm{C}}_{4}{\mathrm{H}}_{8}\mathrm{O} \) have the IR and \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR spectra given below. Suggest a structure for each compound, explaining how you make your deductions. compound A IR: 1730 cm-1; \( {}^{13} \) C NMR: 13.3,15.7,45.7,and 201.6 p.p.m. compound B IR: 3200 (broad) \( {\mathrm{{cm}}}^{-1};{}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR: 36.9,61.3,117.2,and 134.7 p.p.m. compound C IR: no peaks except CH and fingerprint; \( {}^{13} \) C NMR: 25.8 and 67.9 p.p.m. The rest of the problem as stated in the text is given below in the 'Suggested solution'.)

## Purpose of the problem

More practice in the same essential skill. Notice that we have two more \( \mathrm{H} \) atoms in this formula so we have either a ring or a double bond but not both. In addition, a bit of chemistry is added.

## Suggested solution

xmpound A IR: \( {1730}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) (C=O of some sort); \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR: 13.3,15.7,and 45.7 p.p.m. (three saturated carbon atoms with one next to some electron-withdrawing group but not oxygen), and 201.6 p.p.m. (aldehyde or ketone). No symmetry. A ketone would have two \( \mathrm{{Cs}} \) next to \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) so this is just butanal.

The situation is as follows. You have dissolved \( t - \mathrm{{BuOH}}\left( {{\mathrm{{Me}}}_{3}\mathrm{{COH}}}\right) \) in \( \mathrm{{MeCN}} \) with an acid catalyst, left the solution overnight, and found crystals with the following characteristics there in the morning. What are they?

IR: 3435 and \( {1686}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) ; \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR: 169,50,29,and 25 p.p.m.; mass spectrum (%): 115 (7), 100 (10), 64 (5), 60 (21), 59 (17), 58 (100), and 56 (7). (Don't try to assign all of these!)

## Purpose of the problem

Structure determination in real life. This is a common situation - you carry out a reaction and you find a product that is not starting material - what is it? You need to use all the information and some logic. What you must not do is decide what the product is from your (limited) knowledge of chemistry and then make the data fit this structure.

## Suggested solution

The mass spectrum shows that the compound has a molecular ion at 115 and is presumably \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{13}\mathrm{{NO}} \) - the sum of the two reagents \( t \) -BuOH and MeCN. It appears that they have added together but the infrared tells us that neither \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) nor \( \mathrm{{CN}} \) has survived. So what do we know?

- The IR spectrum shows that we have an \( \mathrm{{NH}} \) group and a \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) group,which accounts for both heteroatoms.

- The NMR spectrum shows a carbonyl group (169 p.p.m.) and three types of saturated carbon atom. There must be a lot of symmetry and one explanation might be that the \( t \) -Bu group has survived. This would give us \( \mathrm{{NH}},\mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) ,and \( {\mathrm{{Me}}}_{3}\mathrm{C} \) as three fragments and would leave \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{3} \) left over. We can join these fragments up in two ways.

`CC(C)(C)C(=O)NC.CC(=O)NC(C)(C)C.[Ba].[Ba]`

<!-- Media -->

Each of these structures has four types of carbon atom and could fit the spectra. We might prefer \( 8\mathrm{\;b} \) as the \( \mathrm{{Me}} - \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{N} \) group is still present but a better decision is taken using the mass spectrum fragmentation pattern. The peak at 100 is the loss of 15 (Me) which could occur from either structure,though more typical of \( 8\mathrm{\;b} \) . The base peak (100%) at 58 suggests \( {\mathrm{{Me}}}_{2}\mathrm{C} = {\mathrm{{NH}}}_{2}^{ + } \) ,which can easily come from \( 8\mathrm{\;b} \) but could come from \( 8\mathrm{a} \) only with extensive reorganization of the skeleton. The correct structure is \( 8\mathrm{\;b} \) ,though to be certain we really need \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR too (Chapter 11).

## Problem 9

How many isomers of trichlorobenzene are there? The 1,2,3-trichloro isomer is illustrated. Could they be distinguished by \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR?

## Purpose of the problem

To get you thinking about the possible different structures answering one formula as detemined, say, by the mass spectrum. It is important not to stop trying when you have deduced one possible structure for a set of data but to continue thinking about alternatives. This exercise should help and should also make you think about symmetry.

## Suggested solution

If two of the \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) atoms are next to each other (’ortho’) there are two possible places for the third giving the 1,2,3- and 1,2,4-isomers. If the first two are 1,3-related ('meta') there are again two structures but we have just used one of them (the 1,2,4-isomer). If the first two are placed 1,4 ’para’) there is only one place for the third and we have already found that (the 1,2,4-isomer). There are three isomers in all.

Purpose of the problem

To get you thinking about symmetry.

## Suggested solution

Compound A has tetrahedral symmetry and there are only two types of \( \mathrm{C} \) atom: all the \( \mathrm{{CHs}} \) are the same (a) and all the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\mathrm{\;s} \) are the same (b). This is the famous compound adamantane - a crystalline solid in spite of its being a hydrocarbon with only ten carbon atoms. If you do not see the symmetry, make a molecular model - it is a beautiful structure.

Compound \( \mathrm{B} \) is symmetrical too: the two \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) groups are the same (a) and so are the other atoms in the ring (b). This compound is called quinone and is an orange solid.

Compound \( \mathrm{C} \) is naphthalene (moth balls) and has high symmetry as shown by the labelling \( \mathrm{a},\mathrm{b} \) , and c.

Compound D is 'EDTA' (EthyleneDiamineTetracetic Acid - an important metal chelator). This time there are three types of carbon atom - two of type a and four each of b and c.

Compound E is ’triethanolamine’ used a lot by biochemists. It is also symmetrical with only two types of carbon atom.

## Purpose of the problem

To show you that fragmentation in the mass spectrum is sometimes useful.

## Suggested solution

The three compounds are isomers, \( {\mathrm{C}}_{5}{\mathrm{H}}_{10}\mathrm{O} \) ,and have the same molecular ion at 86 .

Fragmentation of ketones usually occurs next to the \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) group to give first an acylium ion and then, by loss of CO, a carbocation. The fragment ions are different in the three cases. The first compound might lose the methyl or propyl side chains and give two series of fragment ions. Two of the fragments happen to have the same mass (43) so there will be peaks at 86,71,43,and 15 as well as others.

<!-- Media -->

The second ketone is symmetrical and we need show only one fragmentation pattern. There will be peaks at 86,57 , and 29 and the two fragments have different masses from those above.

<!-- Media -->

<!-- Media -->

The third ketone is branched but will give the same basic pattern of fragments as the first compound: 86, 71, 43, 15. How can we tell the difference? The first compound has a long enough chain to do the McLafferty rearrangement losing a molecule (citylene or ethene) and giving a fragment with an even mass.

So, to summarize, the first ketone shows peaks at 86, 71, 58, 43, 45, 45, 45, 50, and 29; and the third at 86, 71, 43, and 15 but with no peak at 54 .

# Suggested solutions for Chapter 4

## Problem 1

In the (notional and best avoided in practice) formation of \( \mathrm{{NaCl}} \) from a sodium atom and a chlorine atom, descriptions like this abound in textbooks: 'an electron is transferred from the valency shell of the sodium atom to the valency shell of the chlorine atom'. What is meant, in quantum number terms, by 'valency shell'? Give a complete description in terms of all four quantum numbers of that transferred electron: (a) while it is in the sodium atom and (b) after it has been transferred to the chlorine atom. Why is the formation of \( \mathrm{{NaCl}} \) by this process to be discouraged?

## Purpose of the problem

To encourage you to use the periodic table in working out the electronic configuration of atoms and to familiarize you with the four quantum numbers.

## Suggested solution

Sodium and chlorine are at either end of the second row of the periodic table: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) ,Ar. Sodium is in group 1 and has the configuration \( 1{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2},2{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2},2{\mathrm{p}}^{6},3{\mathrm{\;s}}^{1} \) . Chlorine is in group VII (17) and has the configuration \( 1{s}^{2},2{s}^{2},2{p}^{6},3{s}^{2},3{p}^{5} \) . The ’valency shell’ refers to the outer shell of the atom where all the chemistry occurs and is known by the value of the principal quantum number(n)for that shell. This is the number at the front of the electronic description: in this case ( \( \mathrm{{Na}} \) or \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) ) the electrons are in \( 3\mathrm{\;s} \) or \( 3\mathrm{p} \) orbitals so \( n = 3 \) .

While the electron is on the sodium atom it is a \( 3\mathrm{\;s} \) electron,that is, \( n = 3;l = 0 \) . There is only one type of s orbital so \( {m}_{l} \) must also be 0 . The spin is arbitrarily up or down so it doesn’t matter whether you say \( {m}_{s} =  - \frac{1}{2} \) or \( + \frac{1}{2} \) . When the electron is transferred to the chlorine atom it goes into a \( 3{\mathrm{p}}_{z} \) orbital so we have \( n = 3 \) again but now \( l = 1 \) (p orbital), \( {m}_{l} \) is \( 1\left( {\mathrm{p}}_{z}\right. \) orbital),and again \( {m}_{s} =  - \frac{1}{2} \) or \( + \frac{1}{2} \) . If any of this gave you trouble,you should refer to the chapter.

This method of making sodium chloride is to be discouraged because both elements are extremely reactive and would combine with an enormous release of energy. This is, of course, because the odd electron on sodium is much more stable if it is transferred to chlorine. We are more likely to make sodium and chlorine from abundant \( \mathrm{{NaCl}} \) - there’s plenty in the sea,for example.

## Problem 2

What is the electronic structure of these species? You should consult a periodic table before answering.

\[\text{HO HS}{}^{ \ominus  }\;\text{HS}{}^{ \oplus  }\;\text{Xe}\]

## Purpose of the problem

To encourage you to use the periodic table in working out the electronic configuration of atoms. We really mean it!

---

- This factor was used in Chapter 3 (p. 68) to explain the relative positions of the stretching frequencies of \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) , \( \mathrm{{NH}} \) ,and \( \mathrm{{CH}} \) in the infrared spectrum.

---

## Suggested solution

\( {\mathrm{H}}^{ - } \) Hydrogen is the first element in the periodic table and has just one proton in the nucleus and just one orbital (1s) available to be filled. If we fill it, we get a species with one proton and two electrons and that is \( {\mathrm{H}}^{ - } \) . The answer is \( 1{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2} \) .

\( {\mathrm{{HS}}}^{ - } \) Sulfur is in group VI (16) in the same row as \( \mathrm{{Na}} \) and \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) . It makes a \( \sigma \) bond to hydrogen and uses the remainder of the electrons as lone pairs to give a full noble gas configuration (same as Ar) of: \( 1{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2},2{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2},2{\mathrm{p}}^{6},3{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2},3{\mathrm{p}}^{6} \) .

Potassium is below sodium in the periodic table so this cation has lost its 4s electron and is: \( 1{s}^{2},2{s}^{2},2{p}^{6},3{s}^{2},3{p}^{6} \) . This configuration is the same as that of \( {\mathrm{{Cl}}}^{ - } \) .

Xe Xenon is a noble gas in group VIII (18). It comes some way down the table after He, Ne, Ar, and \( \mathrm{{Kr}} \) and after two rows of transition elements that fill the \( 3\mathrm{\;d} \) and \( 4\mathrm{\;d} \) orbitals so it has \( 1{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2} \) , \( 2{s}^{2},2{p}^{6},3{s}^{2},3{p}^{6},4{s}^{2},3{d}^{10},4{p}^{6},5{s}^{2},4{d}^{10},5{p}^{6} \) .

## Problem 3

What sort of bonds can be formed between \( s \) orbitals and \( p \) orbitals? Which will provide better overlap, \( 1\mathrm{\;s} + 2\mathrm{p} \) or \( 1\mathrm{\;s} + 3\mathrm{p} \) ? Which bonds will be stronger,those between hydrogen and \( \mathrm{C},\mathrm{N},\mathrm{O} \) ,and \( \mathrm{F} \) on the one hand or those between hydrogen and \( \mathrm{{Si}},\mathrm{P},\mathrm{S} \) ,and \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) on the other? Within the first group,bond strength goes in this order: \( \mathrm{{HF}} > \mathrm{{OH}} > \mathrm{{NH}} > \mathrm{{CH}} \) . Why?

## Purpose of the problem

To encourage you to think about the energies of orbitals as well as just about their quantum description.

## Suggested solution

\( \mathrm{s} \) orbitals and \( \mathrm{p} \) orbitals can combine to form \( \sigma \) bonds. In the chapter (p. 108) we discussed the structure of \( {\mathrm{{PH}}}_{3} \) which has bond angles of about \( {90}^{ \circ  } \) and is made of \( \sigma \) bonds between \( 1\mathrm{\;s}\left( \mathrm{H}\right) \) and 3p(P) orbitals. There is no special problem in overlapping either \( 2\mathrm{p} \) or \( 3\mathrm{p} \) orbitals with 1s orbitals though the \( 3\mathrm{p} \) orbitals are larger.

<!-- Media -->

The difference comes in the energy of the orbitals. The \( 2\mathrm{p} \) orbitals are much closer in energy to the \( 1\mathrm{\;s} \) orbital than the \( 3\mathrm{p} \) orbitals and so the energy gain is greater on \( \sigma \) bond formation.

<!-- Media -->

Bonds between \( \mathrm{H} \) and \( \mathrm{C},\mathrm{N},\mathrm{O} \) ,and \( \mathrm{F} \) are all stronger than bonds between \( \mathrm{H} \) and \( \mathrm{{Si}},\mathrm{P},\mathrm{S} \) ,and \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) . This is partly because \( 2\mathrm{{pAOs}} \) are used for the first but \( 3\mathrm{{pAOs}} \) for the second group. The full story includes the fact that \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{4},{\mathrm{{NH}}}_{3} \) ,and \( {\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O} \) are hybridized (so the lower energy 2s orbitals are used as well) while \( {\mathrm{{PH}}}_{3} \) and \( {\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{\;S} \) are not hybridized. \( {\mathrm{{SiH}}}_{4} \) is,of course,tetrahedral while it is difficult to say whether linear \( \mathrm{{HF}} \) and \( \mathrm{{HCl}} \) are hybridized or not!

Within the group \( \mathrm{C},\mathrm{N},\mathrm{O} \) ,and \( \mathrm{F} \) ,the energy of the 1s orbital stays the same but the energy of the \( 2\mathrm{p} \) (or of the \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{3} \) hybrid orbitals) drops as the elements get more electronegative. These orbitals get closer in energy to the 1s orbital and the gain in bond formation is correspondingly greater.

---

- If you said that this species is hybridized and put electrons into \( 3{\mathrm{{sp}}}^{3} \) orbitals you have done well. This answer is right too.

## Problem 4

Though no helium ’molecule’ \( {\mathrm{{He}}}_{2} \) exists,an ion \( {\mathrm{{He}}}_{2}^{ + } \) does exist. Explain.

## Purpose of the problem

To encourage you to think about the filling of atomic orbitals and to accept surprising conclusions.

## Suggested solution

The orbitals of the \( \mathrm{{He}} \) atom and the fact that no \( {\mathrm{{He}}}_{2} \) molecule exists are discussed in the book on pp. 97-8. The problem is that the 1 s orbitals overlap to form a bonding \( \left( \sigma \right) \) and an antibonding \( \left( {\sigma }^{ * }\right) \) orbital but both would be filled in the \( {\mathrm{{He}}}_{2} \) molecule and the bond order is zero. If there is one fewer electron,only one electron need go into the antibonding orbital \( \left( {\sigma }^{ > }\right) \) and there is a bond order of one-half. The ion \( {\mathrm{{He}}}_{3}^{ + } \) does exist.

## Problem 5

You may be surprised to know that the molecule \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) ,with divalent carbon,can exist. It is,of course, very unstable but it is known and it can have two different structures. One has an \( \mathrm{H} - \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{H} \) bond angle of 180 and the other an angle of 120 . Suggest structures for these species and say which orbitals will be occupied by all bonding and nonbonding electrons. Which structure is likely to be more stable?

## Purpose of the problem

To demonstrate that a simple MO treatment can be applied to strange and unknown molecules.

## Suggested solution

The basic arrangements of the orbitals to get the 180 and 120 bond angles must be an sp hybridized carbon for \( {180}^{ \circ  } \) and an \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2} \) carbon for \( {120}^{ \circ  } \) . This leaves over two p orbitals in the first case but just one \( p \) orbital and an \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2} \) orbital in the second.

There will be four electrons in each of these \( \sigma \) bonds leaving two electrons to make up the six required (divalent carbon has only six valency electrons and cannot achieve a noble gas structure), In the 180 case, the two remaining p orbitals are degenerate so we can put one electron in each. In the \( {120}^{ \circ  } \) case,the remaining \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2} \) orbital is of lower energy than the \( \mathrm{p} \) orbital and will have both electrons. ... 1d nd 1d re is: \( \mathbf{r} \) , ;: 1. c d 5

## Problem 6

Construct an MO diagram for the molecule LiH and suggest what type of bond it might have.

## Purpose of the problem

To demonstrate that a simple MO treatment can be applied to ionic as well as covalent structures.

## Suggested solution

\( \mathrm{H} \) has,of course,only one electron in a 1s orbital. Li has three - a full 1s shell and one electron in the \( 2\mathrm{\;s} \) orbital. Li is also very electropositive so its \( 2\mathrm{\;s} \) orbital is high in energy (much higher than that of F - see the answer to Problem 3). The result is that lithium gives its 2s electron to the 1s orbital of \( \mathrm{H} \) and an ionic compound results with both ions having the same electronic configuration: \( 1{\mathrm{\;s}}^{2} \) . The hydrides of the alkali metals are useful sources of hydride ion \( \left( {\mathrm{H}}^{ - }\right) \) .

## Problem 7

Deduce the MOs for the oxygen molecule. What is the bond order in oxygen and where are the \( {2p} \) electrons?

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

To let you try out your skill in a simple diatomic molecule that has a curious structure.

## Suggested solution

Simply dock two oxygen atoms side by side and overlap the orbitals. The 1s and 2s (only the 2s is shown below) interact as usual but both bonding and antibonding MOs are occupied so there is no bonding. When we overlap the partly filled \( \mathrm{p} \) AOs we find we can make three bonds - one \( 2\mathrm{{p\sigma }} \) and two \( 2\mathrm{p}\pi \) bonds. Now we have two electrons left over and they have to go into antibonding \( 2{\mathrm{{p\pi }}}^{ * } \) MOs. The first two up are degenerate so it is better to put one electron in each and avoid the repulsion from two electrons in the same orbital.

---

You should note that oxygen has four \( 2\mathrm{p} \) electrons and it will have two in one \( p \) orbital and one each in the other two to avoid repulsion.

<!-- Media -->

the oxygen molecule is linked by one \( \sigma \) bond and two \( \pi \) bonds but there are two unpaired in a \( {\pi }^{ * } \) antibonding MO. These reduce the \( \pi \) bond order to 1 and the unpaired electrons are three or less located one on each \( \mathrm{O} \) atom. These unpaired electrons make oxygen very reactive.

## Problem 8

Construct MOs for acetylene (ethyne) without hybridization.

## Propose of the problem

: 5 LOI easy to find molecules where you can construct MOs from AOs without hybridization but Same such. You should not be ashamed if you failed to do this problem and you should be The proud if you succeeded. We shall not in general construct MOs in this way as it is too Efficult but if you simply set up an energy diagram of the AOs, in ascending order as usual, you can the satisfactory MOs.

## Saggested solution

Hence acetylene) has a \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{C} \) triple bond. Each carbon bonds to only two other atoms - the other \( \mathrm{C} \) and the of the Hs. Using MO theory,we can see that only the carbon \( 2\mathrm{\;s} \) and \( 2{\mathrm{p}}_{x} \) have the right venue to bind to two atoms at once which leaves the \( 2{\mathrm{p}}_{y} \) and \( 2{\mathrm{p}}_{z} \) to form \( \pi \mathrm{{MOs}} \) with the \( 2\mathrm{p} \) MTMLs on the other carbon atom.

The three lowest orbitals are \( \sigma \) MOs because they are symmetrical about the line \( \mathrm{H} - \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{H} \) . They are all bonding and all filled but they do not correspond to particular bonds in the molecule. The lowest is bonding right through,the second is bonding for both \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{H} \) s but antibonding for \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{C} \) ,and the third is again bonding for all three bonds. The two top orbitals are \( \pi \) MOs because they have a node (zero electron density) passing through the atoms. They are degenerate and correspond roughly to the two C-C \( \pi \) bonds. The total number of electrons (10) is right for 5 bonds (2 CHs,1 \( \sigma \) CC, and 2 \( \pi \) CCs).

## Purpose of the problem

To give you practice in selecting the right hybridization state for carbon atoms and translating that information into three-dimensional structures for molecules.

## Suggested solution

Carbon dioxide is linear as it has only two C-O \( \sigma \) bonds and no lone pairs on C. The C atom must be sp hybridized and the only trick is to get the two \( \pi \) bonds orthogonal to each other. They must be like that because the \( \mathrm{p} \) orbitals on \( \mathrm{C} \) involved in the two \( \pi \) bonds are themselves orthogonal \( \left( {2{\mathrm{p}}_{y}}\right. \) and \( 2{\mathrm{p}}_{z} \) ). Most people would draw the \( \mathrm{O} \) atoms as \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2} \) hybridized,rather than sp or even unhybridized, but this is unimportant as you can't really tell.

Here we have two cations,two compounds with \( \pi \) bonds,and two with nothing but \( \sigma \) bonds. One of the cations has only three bonds to positively charged carbon so it will react by addition of the nucleophile. The other has three-valent oxygen and so cannot add a nucleophile (four-valent oxygen would have 10 valency electrons and is unknown). The nucleophile must attack the proton instead. Some nucleophiles might attack the carbon atom next to the oxygen.

The two carbonyl compounds will be attacked at the carbon atom with cleavage of the \( \pi \) bond. In general, \( \pi \) bonds are more easily broken than \( \sigma \) bonds and negative charges end up on electronegative atoms. If you proposed that each compound reacted further, you were right, but the expected answers do not include these extra steps shown in square brackets.

The last two molecules are forced to break \( \sigma \) bonds. In the case of chlorine,the two ends are the same so you can attack either \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) atom. In \( \mathrm{{MeSCl}} \) ,the \( \mathrm{S} - \mathrm{{Cl}} \) bond is weaker than the \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{S} \) bond and \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) is the most electrophilic atom in the molecule. The \( \mathrm{S} - \mathrm{{Cl}} \) bond is broken and the negative charge ends up as chloride ion.

## Purpose of the problem

The recognition of nucleophilic sites is the other half of the battle in starting to understand mechanisms. Here is some practice: later you will do this too automatically. Reactions occur when the two meet.

## Suggested solution

This time there are three anions but only two of them (the alkyne and the sulfur anions) have lone pair electrons. We can start our arrows from these and they are the points where the electrophile will attach itself.

The last anion is like the \( {\mathrm{{BH}}}_{4}^{ - } \) anion we discussed on p. 125 of the main text. The negative charge does not show a pair of electrons on \( \mathrm{{Al}} \) but just an imbalance of protons and electrons. All the valency electrons are in the bonds and we must use these \( \sigma \) electrons in the reaction. The arrow should start halfway along the \( \sigma \) bond and emerge through the \( \mathrm{H} \) atom.

One nucleophile has a \( \pi \) bond from \( \mathrm{C} \) to \( \mathrm{N} \) . The nitrogen atom also has a lone pair of electrons and you could start your arrow either there or halfway down the \( \pi \) bond - it doesn’t matter which.

The remaining two nucleophiles have lone pairs. One is symmetrical \( \left( {{\mathrm{{NH}}}_{2} - {\mathrm{{NH}}}_{2}}\right. \) ,hydrazine) and will attack through one nitrogen atom. You may have drawn the product as a cation or you may have removed a proton from it. Either answer is correct.

Finally, the phosphorus compound has four atoms with lone pairs! There are three OMe groups and the phosphorus atom itself. However,the lone pairs on the oxygen atoms are probably in \( 2{\mathrm{{sp}}}^{3} \) orbitals (and are certainly in some kind of orbital with the principal quantum number 2) while that on the phosphorus atom is in a \( 3{\mathrm{{sp}}}^{3} \) orbital and is of higher energy. It reacts.

First practice in interpreting curly arrows and drawing the products. Once the arrows are drawn, there is no more scope for decision-making. You must draw the products.

## Purpose of the problem

First practice in considering different possible reactions. One of the reactions might seem trivial but it isn't.

## Suggested solution

In each case one of the electrophilic sites is an acidic proton. There is also an electrophilic \( \pi \) bond in each case \( \left( {\mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O}}\right. \) or \( \left. {\mathrm{C} = {\mathrm{N}}^{ + }}\right) \) . We might as well use the same abbreviation \( \left( {\mathrm{{Nu}}}^{ - }\right) \) for the nucleophile that we used in Problem 1. For the first case, we draw the two reactions separately.

The last compound also has an electrophilic \( \mathrm{P} \) atom so there are three possibilities. Don't worry if you missed this last one but phosphorus comes below nitrogen in the periodic table and, unlike nitrogen,can have five \( \sigma \) bonds as in \( {\mathrm{{PCl}}}_{5} \) .

<!-- Media -->

Purpose of the problem

To encourage you to draw arrows for unknown reactions and to show you how easy it is.

## Suggested solution

- you have to do is to see which new bonds are formed and which old bonds are broken and draw 25 - ows out of the one into the other. Which way should the arrows go? Take them from an electron-Ecorating atom (an anion in both these examples) towards an electron-accepting atom (O and Br here). In the first example, a hydrogen atom has moved from the left- to the right-hand molecule and this is best shown by an atom-specific arrow.

Don't worry if your arrows are not exactly the same as ours - as long as they start and finish in the right place and move the right \( \mathrm{H} \) atom,they’re all right. The notes on the mechanism are for your guidance - you should not usually include them. The second reaction looks more complicated but the problem is easier - just move electrons through the molecule.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

To encourage you to draw arrows for unknown reactions without help. This time you have to decide how to draw the molecules so that reaction can occur. The compounds and the reactions are much simpler than the last set.

## Suggested solution

In the first example, \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) has replaced \( \mathrm{{Br}} \) . The reagent \( \mathrm{{NaOH}} \) is a salt so the reactive species is the hydroxide anion. We can draw the mechanism in one step with \( {\mathrm{{HO}}}^{ - } \) as a nucleophile displacing stable \( {\mathrm{{Br}}}^{ - } \) from the organic molecule.

The same reagents are used in the second example with the addition of ’EtCH \( {}_{2}\mathrm{{SH}} \) ’. This change is obviously important because the product contains this unit rather than \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) . We should first draw out this compound and use \( \mathrm{{NaOH}} \) as a base to remove a proton from the \( \mathrm{{SH}} \) group. The second step is example (a) with a different nucleophile.

<!-- Media -->

Example (c) uses HBr as the reagent. This is a strong acid with an electrophilic proton. The best nucleophile in the organic compound is the oxygen atom so the first step is a proton transfer and the second step uses the bromide ion,as a nucleophile for the methyl group. Direct attack at \( {\mathrm{O}}^{ + } \) would give impossible four-valent oxygen.

\( {\mathrm{{PhCHBr}}}_{1}{\mathrm{{CHBr}}}_{2}{\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} + {\mathrm{{NaHCO}}}_{3} \rightarrow  \mathrm{{PhCH}} = \mathrm{{CHB}} \)

Hints. First draw good diagrams of the reagents. \( {\mathrm{{NaHCO}}}_{3} \) is a salt and a weak base - strong enough only to remove which proton? Then work out which bonds are formed and which broken, decide whether to push or pull, and draw the arrows. What are the other products?

## Purpose of the problem

To develop your arrow-drawing skill in a more difficult example.

## Suggested solution

Best to follow the advice given in the hint. First, draw the molecules better.

<!-- Media -->

If \( {\mathrm{{NaHCO}}}_{3} \) is a salt we need draw only the anion,as the very stable \( {\mathrm{{Na}}}^{ + } \) won’t do anything. If the anion is a weak base it can remove only the most acidic proton from the organic molecule and that must be the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) proton.

Now we need to lose one \( \mathrm{{Br}} \) atom - the one nearer to the benzene ring - and the whole \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}^{ - } \) group which must fall off as \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2} \) .

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

To get you thinking about equilibria and hence stability of compounds rather than reaction mechanisms.

## Suggested solution

Hydration is an equilibrium reaction so the mechanism is not strictly relevant to the question. If you have drawn the mechanism, you should be proud rather than ashamed because it is an important mechanism. To answer the question we must consider the effect of the three-membered ring. All three-membered rings are unstable because the ring angles are about \( {60}^{ \circ  } \) instead of the usual angle. Cyclopropanone is very strained because the trigonal \( \left( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2}\right) \) carbon would like an angle of \( {120}^{ \circ  } \) and there is \( {60}^{ \circ  } \) of strain’. In the hydrate the trigonal carbon is tetrahedral \( \left( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{3}\right) \) and there is only ' 49 of strain'. The hydrate is more stable than the ketone.

The second case is totally different. The hydroxy-aldehyde is not strained but the hemiacetal has \( {49}^{ \circ  } \) of strain at each corner. Even without strain,hydrates and hemiacetals are normally less stable than aldehydes or ketones because one \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) bond is worth more than two \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{O} \) single bonds. In this case the hemiacetal is even less stable because of strain.

The diol has no \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) group in the \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR or infrared and has a molecular ion in the mass spectrum at two mass units higher than the other two products. Distinguishing them is more tricky. The hydroxy-ketone has a conjugated carbonyl group (about \( {1680}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) in the infrared) but the hydroxy-aldehyde is not conjugated (about \( {1730}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) in the infrared). The chemical shift of the \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{{OH}} \) carbon atoms in the 100-150 p.p.m. region will also be different because the benzene ring is next to this atom in the hydroxy-ketone. Calculations from tables in Williams and Fleming suggest about 80 p.p.m. for the hydroxy-ketone and about 60 p.p.m. for the hydroxy-aldehyde. The mass spectra will also be different - simple \( \alpha \) -cleavage gives quite different fragments.

The evidence shows that there is no carbonyl group in this molecule but that there is an OH group. The peak at 110 p.p.m. looks at first sight like an alkene but that is not possible (try to draw any alkene structures and you will see why) so it must be an unusual saturated carbon atom (perhaps one with two oxygen atoms). You might also argue that an alcohol and a ketone could react to give a hemiacetal, and that, of course, is what it is. The compound exists as the stable cyclic hemiacetal - stable because of the ring size.

Problem 7

Each of these compounds is a hemiacetal and therefore formed from an alcohol and a carbonyl compound. In each case give the structure of these original materials.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

To give you practice in seeing the underlying structure of a hemiacetal.

## Suggested solution

Each OH group represents a carbonyl group in disguise (marked with a black blob). Just remove the other oxygen atom with whatever is attached to it and you have the two components: an alcohol and an aldehyde or a ketone. The first example shows how it is done.

## Problem 8

Trichloroethanol may be prepared by the direct reduction of chloral hydrate in water with sodium borohydride. Suggest a mechanism for this reaction. (Warning! Sodium borohydride does not displace hydroxide from carbon atoms!)

<!-- Media -->

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

To help you detect bad mechanisms and find concealed good ones.

## Suggested solution

\[\text{......}\]

The wrong mechanism, the one the question warns you to avoid, is shown in the margin just to clear the decks. If \( {\mathrm{{NaBH}}}_{4} \) doesn’t displace like this,then what does it do? We know it attacks carbonyl groups to give alcohols and to get trichloroethanol we should have to reduce chloral and we have chloral hydrate. Hydrates are in equilibrium with their carbonyl compounds, so this is the answer!

## Problem 9

It has not been possible to prepare the adducts from simple aldehydes and HCI. What would be the structure of such compounds, if they could be made, and what would be the mechanism of their formation? Why cannot these compounds in fact be made?

## Purpose of the problem

More revision of equilibria to help you develop a judgement about stability.

## Suggested solution

This time we need a mechanism so that we can work out what would be formed. Protonation of the carbonyl group and then nucleophilic addition of chloride ion gives the supposed product.

<!-- Media -->

`C(OC(Cl)([R])[R])[R].CC#CC.CC#CC.C(=O)(O)[R].C(O)(O)([R])[R19a].CC.CC.CC.Cl`

<!-- Media -->

There's nothing wrong with the mechanism; it's just that the reaction is an equilibrium that will run backwards. Hemiacetals are unstable because they decompose back to carbonyl compound and alcohol. Chloride ion is very stable and this reaction will run backwards even more readily.

<!-- Media -->

What would be the products of these reactions? In each case give a mechanism to justify your predictions.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

To give you practice in the art of predicting products, more difficult than simply justifying a known auswer.

## Suggested solution

Each of these reactions is straight out of the textbook and each is a simple addition to the carbonyl group. The first is cyanohydrin formation and you need to draw out the aldehyde group to make a good job of the mechanism.

## Problem 11

The equilibrium constant \( {K}_{\mathrm{{eq}}} \) for formation of the cyanohydrin of cyclopentanone and HCN is 67, while for butan-2-one and HCN it is 28 . Explain.

## Purpose of the problem

More revision of equilibria, this time with some numbers.

## Suggested solution

We need first to state the problem in chemistry rather than in writing.

<!-- Media -->

`C1CCC(C1)OC(N=C=NC2(CCC(CC2)(O)O)O)[X16].CCC(=O)C[X16]([H])([H])[X15]([H])([H])CCC(C)(O)O`

<!-- Media -->

The two ketones are very similar, the ring being the main difference. The two equilibrium constants are also very similar as \( {K}_{\mathrm{{eq}}} \) is a simple ratio of [cyanohydrin] to [ketone] and is not on a log scale. There is a factor of about 2.5 between the two examples. There is, of course, some strain in the five-membered ring (angle \( {108}^{ \circ  } \) ) but only at the carbonyl group (ideal angle \( {120}^{ \circ  } \) ). Replacing the trigonal centre by a tetrahedral centre so that the ideal angle \( \left( {109}^{ \circ  }\right) \) is almost identical to the actual angle is enough to explain this small factor.

## Suggested solutions for Chapter 7

## Purpose of the problem

2 Insion of the basic kinds of conjugation and how to show conjugation with curly arrows.

## Saggested solution

The first two are straightforward with one conjugated system (an enone) in the first example and - (a phenyl alkyne) in the second. Of course, the benzene ring is itself conjugated in the - cound example. You can show either or both with curly arrows: we have done so for the first - mple only.

The last three compounds obviously form a group with the same skeleton and only the alkene moved around. There is, of course, ester conjugation in all three but this is the only kind in the last amound. The first is most conjugated with the lone pair on nitrogen delocalized into the carbonyl map. The middle compound just has the alkene and the ester conjugated. This time we have used array arrow representations for all three compounds and a dotted-line electron distribution - mary for the first.

Draw a full orbital diagram for all the bonding and antibonding \( \pi \) orbitals in the three-membered cyclic cation shown here. The molecule is obviously very strained. Might it survive by also being aromatic?

## Purpose of the problem

Revision of MO diagrams for conjugated systems with aromaticity.

## Suggested solution

There are only two electrons in this simple cation but we need to mix the \( \pi \) bond \( \left( \pi \right. \) and \( \left. {{\pi }^{ * }\text{orbitals}}\right) \) with the empty \( p \) orbital to give the MOs. One MO will be bonding all round the ring and this is the only one that matters to the structure. The others may have given you problems. We can mix the pAO with the \( \pi  - \mathrm{{MO}} \) as they have the same symmetry in a three-membered ring but we cannot mix p with \( {\pi }^{ * } \) . So our three MOs are \( \pi  + p,\pi  - p \) ,and \( {\pi }^{ * } \) .

<!-- Media -->

The cyclic cation is stable and can be made because of the gain in energy in populating only the lowest ali-bonding orbital. As it happens \( {\Psi }_{2} \) and \( {\Psi }_{3} \) are degenerate. If you count the number of bonding and antibonding interactions in each you will see that the net result is one antibonding interaction in both orbitals. It is also aromatic,having \( {4n} + {2\pi } \) -electrons where \( n = 0 \) .

You get the same result if you mix three p-AOs, one on each carbon atom. Then it is easier if we look down on the ring showing the top lobe of the p orbital at each atom. The lowest, all-bonding orbital has no nodes (except the plane of the ring) and the two degenerate, antibonding, and unoccupied orbitals have one node each.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

A chance to delve more deeply into what is meant by conjugation.

## Suggested solution

The \( \beta \) -lactam has two clearly defined conjugating systems: the amide and the more extended unsaturated acid going right through to the sulfur atom. These are shown by curly arrows on the first diagram. These systems are joined by a single bonds so they really are one system: all the p orbitals on the ringed atoms in the second diagram are more or less parallel and all are conjugated.

<!-- Media -->

Podophyllotoxin has the obvious two benzene rings and cyclic ester conjugation, shown by curly arrows on the first diagram. Each benzene ring has substituents with lone pairs shown on the second diagram so this molecule has no less than six lone pairs of electrons involved in extended conjugation.

Draw diagrams to illustrate the conjugation present in these molecules. You should draw three types of diagram: (a) conjugation arrows to give at least two different ways of representing the molecule joined by the correct 'reaction' arrow; (b) a diagram with dotted lines and partial charges (if any) to show the double bond and charge distribution (if any); and (c) a diagram of the atomic orbitals that make up the lowest-energy bonding molecular orbital.

## Purpose of the problem

A more exacting exploration of the precise details of conjugation.

## Suggested solution

Treating each molecule separately in the styles demanded by the question, the first compound is the guanidinium ion, a very stable cation because of conjugation. The curly arrows in the first set of diagrams show that each nitrogen has an equal amount of positive charge and this is reflected in the second diagram showing exactly one-third + on each \( \mathrm{N} \) . The third diagram,of the lowest-energy MO, looks down on the molecule and shows the top lobe of the p orbital on each atom.

The second molecule is what we shall learn to call an enolate ion. The negative charge is delocalized throughout the conjugated system but is particularly on the two oxygen atoms and, to a lesser extent, on the central carbon atom. It is difficult to represent this accurately with partial charges but the charge on each oxygen atom is nearly a half. The lowest-energy MO has all the p orbitals in phase.

The third compound is naphthalene. The structure drawn is the best; curly arrow diagrams do not do this molecule justice and other versions are less convincing. In particular, they do not show that the middle bond common to both rings is the shortest bond. There are no charges anywhere and all the \( \mathrm{p} \) orbitals are conjugated. This is the basic ten-electron aromatic system. Problem 5

## Purpose of the problem

A simple exploration of the idea of aromaticity: can you count to six?

## Suggested solution

The first three compounds are straightforward providing you count lone pair electrons on atoms in the ring and do not count electrons outside the ring such as those in the carbonyl \( \pi \) bond in the first compound. Nor should you count the lone pair represented by the negative charge in the third compound. They are in an \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2} \) orbital in the plane of the ring.

The rest offer variations on the benzene ring and each ring must be considered separately. Methoxatin has five- and six-membered rings with nitrogen in them. Count the lone pair in a \( \mathrm{p} \) orbital on the nitrogen atom in the five-membered ring but not those in an \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2} \) orbital in the six-membered ring (pyridine). Both are aromatic. Colchicine has an aromatic seven-membered ring with six electrons (don’t count the \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) group) while callistephin has an interesting positively charged aromatic ring with three double bonds.

## Purpose of the problem

To get you thinking about the relationship between conjugation and light absorption.

## Suggested solution

Each dyestuff has essentially the same conjugated system shown here isolated from extra substituents. The positive charge is shared between the two nitrogen atoms and the whole system is symmetrical. The colour is due to excitation of the lone pair electrons, which are delocalized over the whole system,into an antibonding \( {\pi }^{ * } \) orbital of the aromatic system. There will be many bonding \( \pi \) orbitals and the same number of antibonding \( {\pi }^{ * } \) orbitals. The lowest (the LUMO) will be unusually low in energy and the \( \mathrm{n},{\pi }^{ * } \) is in the visible region.

<!-- Media -->

The substituent on the middle atom is different in the two dyes and is also conjugating. This extra conjugation decides the exact shade of colour with the highly conjugating naphthalene ring in E142 taking the absorption all the way through to red light so the dye appears green to the eye. The \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group also helps as a lone pair is also conjugated into the aromatic rings. The sulfonate groups make the compound water-soluble.

Comment on the structures in comparison with those in Problem 6 and suggest where they get their colour from and why they too have extra functional groups. Then turn to the beginning of Chapter 1 (p. 3) and look at the structures of the compounds in the 'spectrum of molecules'. Can you see what kind of absorption leads to each colour? You will want to think about the conjugation in each molecule but you should not expect to correlate structures with wavelengths in any even roughly quantitative way.

## Purpose of the problem

- ther thoughts on the relationship between conjugation and light absorption plus revision of Lhapter 1.

## Suggested solution

One of the dyestuffs in the shaving foam, Fast Green FCF, has a conjugated system very similar to those we have just been discussing in Problem 6, though it has extra solubilizing substituents on the Eurrogen atom.

Quinoline yellow is quite different. It has two conjugated ring systems linked by a single bond. However,they are also linked by conjugation from the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group in one ring to the nitrogen atom in the other. In fact, the whole molecule is conjugated. Because the conjugation is more limited, this molecule absorbs violet light and so appears yellow. It has the usual sulfonate solubilizing groups. The 'quinoline' part of the name refers to the left-hand ring system.

You probably found 'red' easiest to deal with as there is an obvious extended conjugation throughout the whole molecule. The conjugation in 'blue' is less obvious but clearly more effective (a blue compound absorbs longer wavelength light than a red compound) and relies on a redistribution of electrons that makes both rings aromatic.

The orange and yellow compounds owe their colour to functionality. 'Orange' is a quinone - a conjugated six-membered ring compound with four electrons - and has a low-energy unoccupied orbital (a \( {\pi }^{ * } \) orbital,the LUMO) from the two conjugated carbonyl groups,which is easily occupied by excitation of a \( \pi \) electron. ’Yellow’ is diazomethane,an unstable toxic and even explosive gas. which has some conjugation in its very small framework but owes its colour mainly to the \( \mathrm{N} = \mathrm{N} \) functionality which again has a low-energy \( {\pi }^{ * } \) orbital.

The green compound, delightfully named 9-nitrosojulolidine, has conventional conjugation of an efficient sort between electron-donating \( \mathrm{N} \) and the electron-accepting nitroso group \( \left( {\mathrm{N} = \mathrm{O}}\right) \) . Nitroso compounds can be brightly coloured without any conjugation as is the case with 'purple'. It is very unusual to have blue or purple gases and this compound has a \( {\mathrm{{CF}}}_{3} \) group to stabilize the nitroso group which, when not conjugated, is an odd-electron compound. The colour comes from excitation of a lone pair electron into the \( \mathrm{N} = \mathrm{O} \) antibonding orbital.

## Problem 8

Go through the list of aromatic compounds at the end of the chapter and see how many electrons there are in the rings taken separately or taken together (if they are fused). Are all the numbers of the \( \left( {{4n} + 2}\right) \) kind?

## Purpose of the problem

Revision of simple acidity and basicity in a practical situation.

## Suggested solution

Pyridine is a weak base \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}{5.5}}\right) \) and can be dissolved in aqueous acid. \( p \) -Toluic acid is a weak acid ( \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) about 4.5) and can be dissolved in aqueous base. Naphthalene is neither an acid nor a base and remains insoluble in water at any \( \mathrm{{pH}} \) . So,dissolve the mixture in an organic solvent immiscible with water (say ether, \( {\mathrm{{Et}}}_{2}\mathrm{O} \) ,or \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}{\mathrm{{Cl}}}_{2} \) ) and extract with aqueous acid \( \left( {\mathrm{{pH}} < 4}\right) \) ; this will remove the pyridine as an aqueous solution of its protonated form. Then extract the remaining organic layer with aqueous base \( \left( {\mathrm{{pH}} > 6}\right) \) which will extract the \( p \) -toluic acid as its anion. You now have three solutions. Evaporate the organic solution of naphthalene and recrystallize it to get pure naphthalene. Acidify the basic solution of \( p \) -toluic acid to precipitate the free acid and recrystallize it. Finally,add base to the pyridine solution,extract the pyridine with an organic solvent,(say ether, \( {\mathrm{{Et}}}_{2}\mathrm{O} \) ,or \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}{\mathrm{{Cl}}}_{2} \) ),evaporate the solvent,and distil the pyridine. It is just as good to extract with base first and acid second.

## Problem 2

In the separation of benzoic acid from toluene we suggested using \( \mathrm{{NaOH}} \) solution. How concentrated a solution would be necessary to ensure that the \( \mathrm{{pH}} \) was above the \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) of benzoic acid \( \left( {p{K}_{a}}\right. \) 4.2)? How would you estimate how much solution to use?

## Purpose of the problem

You can check your understanding of the relationship between \( \mathrm{{pH}} \) and concentration.

## Suggested solution

Even a very weak solution of \( \mathrm{{NaOH}} \) will have a \( \mathrm{{pH}} > {4.2} \) . By the calculation on p. 184 of the chapter, for a \( \mathrm{{pH}} \) of 5 we should need \( \left\lbrack  {{\mathrm{H}}_{3}{\mathrm{O}}^{ + }}\right\rbrack   = {10}^{-5}\mathrm{\;{mol}}{\mathrm{{dm}}}^{-1} \) . We know that the ionic product of water is \( \left\lbrack  {{\mathrm{H}}_{3}{\mathrm{O}}^{ + }}\right\rbrack  \left\lbrack  {\mathrm{{OH}}}^{ - }\right\rbrack   = {10}^{-{14}} \) and so for \( \mathrm{{pH}}5 \) we need \( {10}^{-5}\mathrm{\;{mol}}{\mathrm{{dm}}}^{-1} \) of \( \mathrm{{NaOH}} \) . This is very dilute! The trouble is that you need one hydroxide ion for every molecule of benzoic acid so if you had, say, \( {1.22}\mathrm{\;g}{\mathrm{{PhCO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H}\left( { = {0.01}\text{equiv.}}\right) \) you would need 1000 litres \( \left( {\mathrm{{dm}}}^{-1}\right) \) of your \( \mathrm{{NaOH}} \) solution. It makes more sense to have a much more concentrated solution, say, 0.1M. This would give an unnecessarily high \( \mathrm{{pH}} \) of 13 but you would need only \( {100}\mathrm{{ml}}\left( {\mathrm{{cm}}}^{3}\right) \) to extract your benzoic acid.

<!-- Media -->

What species would be present if you were to dissolve this hydroxy-acid in: (a) water at \( \mathrm{{pH}}7 \) ;

(b) aqueous alkali at \( \mathrm{{pH}}{12} \) ; or (c) a concentrated solution of a mineral acid?

## Purpose of the problem

Revision of simple acidity and basicity requiring \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) values in a practical situation.

## Suggested solution

The \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) group will have a \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) of about 4-5 and the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group a \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) of about 10 . This gives a comfortable margin between the two ionizations. At \( \mathrm{{pH}}7 \) the acid will be ionized and at \( \mathrm{{pH}}{12} \) both groups will be ionized. In concentrated mineral acid both will have their protons and the carboxylic acid will start to be protonated. It is more readily protonated than the isolated \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group as it gives a delocalized cation.

## Purpose of the problem

Progressing towards more taxing judgements on more interesting molecules.

## Suggested solution

The simple amine,piperidine,will have a normal amine \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}} \) of about 11 so it will be easy to protonate with even very weak acids. Any mineral acid like \( \mathrm{{HCl}} \) will do as would weaker acids like \( {\mathrm{{RCO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) . Deprotonation will remove the \( \mathrm{{NH}} \) proton as nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon but a very strong base such as BuLi will be needed as the \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) will be about 30-35 .

The next example is more complicated but actually contains a normal tertiary amine \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}}}\right. \) about 11) and a normal primary alcohol ( \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) about 16). Protonation at nitrogen will occur with any acid - let’s choose \( \mathrm{{TsOH}} \) this time - and deprotonation will occur at the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group and will need a strong base - let’s say \( \mathrm{{NaH}} \) .

<!-- Media -->

The final example is the most complicated one. There is a normal \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}}\right. \) about 16 and a slightly acidic alkyne \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}}\right. \) about 32 ) so the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) will be deprotonated first. The basic group is not a normal amine but an amidine in which the two nitrogen atoms can combine (see arrows) to capture a proton. It will have a \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) of about 12 and so would even be protonated by a phenol though most chemists would use a carboxylic acid.

## Purpose of the problem

Learning to compare species of similar acidity or basicity.

## Suggested solution

In each case one of the reagents might take a proton from the other. In example (a), would the anion of the phenol remove a proton from the carboxylic acid? We can answer that by considering \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) values. The answer is yes. There are five \( \mathrm{{pH}} \) units between the two acids so the equilibrium will be well to the right. The equilibrium constant is about \( {10}^{5} \) .

The alkoxide will be formed first, and then a second deprotonation is possible because the two negative charges are far apart in the dianion and will not significantly destabilize each other.

## Suggested solution

Both compounds are quite polar and not very soluble in the usual organic NMR solvents. In addition, they have \( \mathrm{{NH}} \) or \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) protons that exchange and broaden the signals. If the exchange is made rapid by acid or base catalysis and the NHs and OHs exchanged for deuterium, all these problems disappear and clean sharp spectra result. The first compound is a guanidine and forms a cation in acid. The cation is symmetrical and a very simple spectrum results - just three types of carbon in the aromatic region and one very low field carbon (at large \( \delta \) ) for the carbon in the middle of the cation.

A problem requiring detailed interpretation of electronic effects.

## Suggested solution

Electron-withdrawing groups \( \left( \mathrm{{Cl}}\right. \) and even more so \( \left. {\mathrm{{NO}}}_{2}\right) \) make phenols more acidic but electron-donating groups (Me) make them less acidic. The nitro group is very effective if it can stabilize the anion by conjugation. A \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) value of about 10 is normal for a phenol,so it is phenol itself that has that value. The compound less acidic than phenol \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}{11}}\right) \) must be the trimethyl compound. One chlorine atom will make phenol slightly more acidic so \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}9 \) must be 3-chlorophenol and the compounds with one nitro group \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}7}\right) \) or two \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}4}\right) \) must be the very acidic phenols. Problem 10

Discuss the stabilization of the anions formed by the deprotonation of (a) and (b) and the cation formed by the protonation of (c). Consider delocalization in general and the possibility of aromaticity in particular.

There is only one remotely acidic proton in (a), the NH proton. Removal of this gives an anion that 25- be delocalized on to all the four nitrogen atoms in the five-membered ring. The combination of fede relectronegative atoms, a delocalized anion, and an aromatic anion (see diagram in margin) Takes this a very stable anion and the original amine is a real acid with a \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) (5) about the same as that of a carboxylic acid \( \left( {{\mathrm{{RCO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H}}\right) \) .

The most acidic proton in (b) is that of the phenol and the anion is delocalized round the sentence ring, into the fused five-membered ring, and even out on to the ketone oxygen atom so it is anion. However, there are only eight delocalized electrons altogether so, although the remains aromatic, there is no extra stabilization from any aromaticity in the acacalized five-membered ring or in the system as a whole. It has a \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) value of about 8.5.

The diamine (c) will be protonated on the trigonal \( \left( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2}\right) \) nitrogen using the delocalized lone pair = 2 P orbital on the other nitrogen. The resulting cation is delocalized in exactly the same way so the two nitrogen atoms are the same. Both rings are aromatic (though neither valence bond frozum shows both rings as aromatic) as there are 12 electrons delocalized - six for each ring. The as a whole isn't aromatic because it is not one conjugated ring system.

## Purpose of the problem

To get you thinking about carbon acids, how their anions are delocalized, and what makes the anions stable.

## Suggested solution

All these carbon acids give anions whose negative charge is mainly on oxygen. Similar ones are described in the chapter (Table 8.2,p. 193) and we expect simple carbonyl compounds to have \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}\mathrm{s} \) of about 15- 20 and 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds to have \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}\mathrm{s} \) of about 5-15. The first three compounds are all ketones on the left and have ketone, aldehyde, and ester groups on the right, respectively. The charge is delocalized over both carbonyl groups. The aldehyde is most effective as it is a simple carbonyl group. The ketone has \( \sigma \) -conjugation,which reduces the effectiveness of the carbonyl delocalization,and the ester is worst as it has competing conjugation from the ester oxygen atom.

<!-- Media -->

The next compound has only one carbonyl group but gains a little acidity from the electronegative chlorine atom - it is a proton from that side of the ketone that is lost. Delocalizing the charge on to the carbon atoms shows this.

## Suggested solution

The \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group is the Wicked Witch of the West in this problem. Whoever planned these syntheses expected it to lie quietly and do nothing. But,although an \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group is only a weak acid \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}}\right. \) about

<!-- Media -->

Your explanation may not be exactly the same as either of these - the only important thing is that you should have some way of getting the reaction to occur at the other end of the allylic system. The \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) distribution in the product would be determined by NMR spectra. Each labelled atom would appear as a much stronger signal (the natural abundance of \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) is 1.1%) and each signal will be in a different part of the spectrum.

## Suggested solution

The first example is a vinyl bromide and vinyl \( \left( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2}\right) \) carbanions are more stable than saturated \( \left( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{3}\right) \) carbanions because of the greater \( s \) character in the \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{{Li}}\sigma \) bond.

<!-- Media -->

What does not happen is Grignard formation at the aryl chloride - bromides are more reactive than chlorides towards Grignard formation. Furthermore, nucleophilic attack occurs at the carbonyl group and not at the \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{N} \) group of the electrophile. This is because \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{N} \) is less electrophilic than \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) ( \( \mathrm{N} \) is less electronegative than \( \mathrm{O} \) ) and also because attack at \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{N} \) would destroy the aromaticity of the pyridine ring.

This scheme is wrong because simple alkenes are not reduced with \( {\mathrm{{NaBH}}}_{4} \) ,which is a maleophilic reducing agent and attacks alkenes only if they are conjugated with an electron-withdrawing group. The conjugate addition must always be done first while the carbonyl group is zetact. See Problem 2 for a simpler example.

## Purpose of the problem

Extension of simple ideas to more exotic reagents with trapping of the intermediate.

## Suggested solution

The phosphine is a soft reversible nucleophile and is good at conjugate addition while unsaturated ketones are good at both types of reaction. On balance, conjugate addition wins. The intermediate enolate is trapped by silicon - an excellent electrophile for oxygen. The product is indeed a cation. The nucleophile was neutral and has lost electrons in the addition step. The counterion is chloride as all the atoms in the reagents are incorporated into the product.

The added fragment is obviously a butyl group and the nucleophile should be BuLi, BuMgBr, or some other organometallic reagent. The two we have mentioned prefer direct addition and we shall have to add \( \mathrm{{Cu}}\left( \mathrm{I}\right) \) to get conjugate addition.

Estimating the chemical shift requires an adjustment to the narrower range of proton shifts plus a new region - aromatic as distinct from alkene. In each case we give a reasonable estimate and then the actual values. If your values agree with our estimates, you have done well. If you get something near the actual values,be very proud of yourself. The first compound has hydrogens on \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2} \) carbon atoms bonded to two nitrogen atoms - hence the very large shift. The fourth molecule has two methyl groups directly bonded to electropositive silicon - hence the very small shift. The rest are more easily explained.

## Purpose of the problem

Simple correlation of structure and chemical shift.

## Suggested solution

The nitro group is a strongly electron-withdrawing group and would be expected to remove electron shielding from neighbouring hydrogen atoms. A \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{3} \) group would normally come at about 1.2 p.p.m. so one nitro group has shifted this downfield by about 3 p.p.m. The second adds less than 2 p.p.m. and the third only just 1.4 p.p.m. These diminishing effects are much smaller than the effects on \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) ,which is a log scale, but in the same direction. There is a kind of correlation showing that removing electrons from a \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{H} \) bond makes it more acidic and also increases the chemical shift.

## Problem 3

One isomer of dimethoxybenzoic acid has the \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR spectrum \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) (p.p.m.) 3.85 (6H,s), 6.63 (1H,t,J 2Hz),7.17 (2H,d,J 2Hz) and one isomer of coumalic acid has the \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR spectrum \( {\delta }_{H} \) (p.p.m.) 6.41 (1H,d,J 10 Hz),7.82 (1H,dd,J 2,10 Hz),and 8.51 (1H,d, \( \mathrm{J}2\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) ).

The second compound has one coupling of \( {10}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) and this must be between neighbours. The ther coupling is \( 2\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) and this must be meta coupling. There are two structures that might be right. In fact, the first is correct and you might have worked that out by the very large chemical shift - almost in the aldehyde region - of the isolated proton with only a \( 2\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) coupling. This is on - alkene carbon bonded to oxygen in the first structure but on a simple alkene carbon in the second.

This is enough to assign the spectrum but we should check that the chemical shifts are right too, and they are.

The carbon spectrum is more familiar to you from Chapter 3 and you will remember that regration means little here. There are three peaks in the \( 0 - {50} \) p.p.m. region corresponding to the The thyl group on the alkene,the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) group,and the pair of methyls on the same carbon atom. The 11:1 triplet at 77 p.p.m. is the solvent \( {\mathrm{{CDCl}}}_{3} \) . The other signal in the \( {50} - {100} \) p.p.m. region must be the carbon next to oxygen \( \left( {{\mathrm{{Me}}}_{2}\mathrm{{CO}}}\right) \) . The two signals in the 100-150 p.p.m. region are the two Errions of the alkene and the very small peak above 150 p.p.m. must be the carbonyl group. No further assignment is necessary.

## Purpose of the problem

First serious practice in correlating splitting patterns and chemical shifts.

## Suggested solution

Redrawing the molecules with all hydrogens showing probably helps at this stage, though you will not do this for long. The spectrum of 1-nitrobutane can be assigned by integration and splitting pattern without even looking at the chemical shifts! Just counting the number of neighbours and adding one gives the multiplicity of the signals and leads to the assignment in the frame. It is equally valid to start with the chemical shift,which you would expect to get steadily smaller as the \( \mathrm{H} \) atoms are more distant from the \( {\mathrm{{NO}}}_{2} \) group. Everything fits.

The next compound has an isopropyl group,typically a \( 6\mathrm{H} \) doublet at about \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}1 \) p.p.m. and a \( 1\mathrm{H} \) septuplet with a larger chemical shift so they can be quickly found.

## Purpose of the problem

To show that it is helpful to predict the NMR spectrum of an expected product provided that the structure is rejected if the spectrum is 'wrong'.

## Suggested solution

The spectrum is all wrong. There are only three aromatic Hs (7.0-7.5 p.p.m.), not the four expected. There are two exchanging hydrogens,presumably \( {\mathrm{{NH}}}_{2} \) ,and not the one expected. The only thing 3. is as expected is the chain of three \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) groups. You could not be expected to find the right structure, which is actually an amide with a new carbocyclic ring.

For the rest of 3 - agnals,you should have measured the \( J \) values. Coupling is measured in \( \mathrm{{Hz}} \) and at \( {400}\mathrm{{MHz}} \) such chemical shift unit of 1 p.p.m. is \( {400}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) ,so each subunit of 0.1 p.p.m. is \( {40}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) .

That gives us three protons in the alkene region,five \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) groups,and one solitary proton,which HK only the alkyne proton. If you were surprised by its small chemical shift, check the tables and as all right. In the alkene region,the multiplet must be \( {\mathrm{H}}^{2} \) which couples to the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) at \( \mathrm{C}3 \) and H s. On \( \mathrm{{Cl}},{\mathrm{H}}^{1\mathrm{a}} \) has a large trans coupling(16Hz)to \( {\mathrm{H}}^{2} \) while \( {\mathrm{H}}^{1\mathrm{\;b}} \) has a smaller \( c \) is coupling (M Hz).

Checking the integral will deal with that problem. The propyl side chain is still there with a \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{3} \) triplet,a \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) quintet,and a \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) triplet with a large chemical shift. The broad signal at \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{5.9} \) p.p.m. is typical of an NH group so no reaction has happened there. The small signal - less than a quarter of a proton - at 7.2 p.p.m. cannot be part of the molecule and must be \( {\mathrm{{CHCl}}}_{3} \) . The remaining signals in the aromatic region at 6.3,8.1,and 9.1 p.p.m. must be three protons on the pyridine ring. The nitro group has replaced one of the original four and is somewhere on the pyridine ring. These are the possibilities.

The most significant feature of the aromatic region is a proton at very large chemical shift (9.1 p.p.m.) with no coupling to speak of (there might be some long-range coupling). This proton has no neighbours and that rules out the 3-nitro and 6-nitro compounds. If you check in tables you will see that protons on carbons next to nitrogen (C2 and C6) in pyridine have very large shifts as you would expect from their aldehyde-like nature. The nitro group also increases the shifts of protons on neighbouring carbon atoms. The compound must be 5-nitro and the spectrum can be assigned like this.

<!-- Media -->

The coupling in the side chain is all about \( 7\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) as expected and that between \( \mathrm{C}3 \) and \( \mathrm{C}4 \) in the pyridine ring is somewhat larger also as expected for an aromatic ring. The smaller chemical shift of the proton at \( \mathrm{C}3 \) occurs because it is not affected by the nitro group but it is affected by electron donation from the amine nitrogen atom.

9A

alleged bullatenone

<!-- Media -->

The natural product bullatenone was isolated in the 1950s from a New Zealand myrtle and assigned the structure 9A. Then compound 9A was synthesized and found not to be identical with natural bullatenone. Predict the expected \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR spectrum of 9A. Given the full spectroscopic data available nowadays, but not in the 1950s, say why 9A is definitely wrong and suggest a better structure for builatenone.

## Spectra of bullatenone:

Mass spectrum: \( \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{z}{188}\left( {{10}\% }\right) \) (high resolution confirms \( {\mathrm{C}}_{12}{\mathrm{H}}_{12}{\mathrm{O}}_{2} \) ), 105 (20%), 102 (100%), and 77 (20%).

Infrared: 1604 and \( {1705}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) .

\( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR: \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) (p.p.m.) 1.45 \( \left( {6\mathrm{H},\mathrm{s}}\right) ,{5.82}\left( {1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{s}}\right) ,{7.35}\left( {3\mathrm{H},\mathrm{m}}\right) \) ,and 7.68(2H,m).

## Purpose of the problem

Detecting wrong structures is fun and teaches us to be alert to what the spectra are telling us rather than what we expect.

## Suggested solution

The mass spectrum and infrared are all right for structure 9A but the NMR shows at once that bullatenone cannot be \( 9\mathrm{\;A} \) . There is indeed a monosubstituted benzene ring (the \( 2\mathrm{H} \) and \( 3\mathrm{H} \) signals in the aromatic region confirm this) but the aliphatic protons consist of a \( 6\mathrm{H} \) signal,almost certainly a \( {\mathrm{{CMe}}}_{2} \) group,and a \( 1\mathrm{H} \) singlet in the alkene region at 5.82 p.p.m.

The fragments we have are \( \mathrm{{Ph}} \) ,carbonyl,and \( {\mathrm{{CMe}}}_{2} \) groups and an alkene with one \( \mathrm{H} \) on it. That adds up to \( {\mathrm{C}}_{12}{\mathrm{H}}_{12}\mathrm{O} \) and leaves only one oxygen atom to fit in. There must still be a ring or else there will be too few hydrogen atoms and the ring is five-membered (just try other possibilities yourself). There are three basic rings we can choose and each can have the phenyl group on either end of the double bond making six possibilities in all.

<!-- Media -->

The last four are all esters (cyclic esters or lactones) and they would have IR carbonyl stretches at higher frequency in the \( {1745} - {1780}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) range. The hydrogen on the alkene cannot be on the same carbon atom as the oxygen or it would be at a very large shift indeed whereas it is close to the 'normal' alkene shift of 5.25 p.p.m. For 9C we could estimate 5.25 + 0.64 p.p.m. for O, + 0.36 p.p.m. for Ph, and \( + {0.87}\mathrm{p} \) .p.m. for \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) making 7.12 p.p.m.,a long way from the observed 5.82 p.p.m. Structure 9B is correct and the spectra can be assigned.

Compound \( 9\mathrm{\;B} \) was synthesized and proved identical to natural bullatenone.

## Problem 10

Interpret this \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR spectrum (see text,p. 277,for the 90 MHz NMR of the compound in the margin).

## Purpose of the problem

Further correlation of chemical shift and coupling with interpretation of longer-range coupling.

## Suggested solution

The ethyl group is easy to find - a typical \( 3\mathrm{H} \) triplet at 1.2 p.p.m. and a \( 2\mathrm{H} \) quartet at 4.3 p.p.m. - not just an ethyl group but an OEt group to get the large shift for the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) group. The methyl group is also easy - a \( 3\mathrm{H} \) singlet at 2.6 p.p.m.,typical of a methyl on an alkene. At the other end of the spectrum,the broad signal at 11.0 p.p.m. can be only the \( \mathrm{{NH}} \) or the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) - one exchanges and is not seen. That leaves the three signals in the aromatic region: \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) (p.p.m.) 6.75 (1H,dd,J 9,2 Hz), 7.15 (1H,d,J 9 Hz),and 7.48 (1H,d,J 2 Hz). The larger coupling is a typical ortho and the smaller a typical meta coupling so we can assign the whole spectrum. Problem 11

## Problem 12

Precocene is a compound that causes insect larvae to pupate and can also be found in some plants (Ageratum spp.) where it may act as an insecticide. It was isolated in minute amounts and has the following spectroscopic details. Propose a structure for precocene. Spectra of precocene:

Mass spectrum: \( \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{z} \) (high resolution gives \( {\mathrm{C}}_{13}{\mathrm{H}}_{16}{\mathrm{O}}_{3} \) ), \( \mathrm{M} - {15}\left( {{100}\% }\right) \) and \( \mathrm{M} - {30} \) (weak)

Infrared: \( \mathrm{{CH}} \) and fingerprint only.

\( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR: \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) (p.p.m.) 1.34 (6H,s),3.80 (3H,s),3.82 (3H,s),5.54 (1H,d,J 10 Hz),6.37 (1H, d, J 10 Hz), 6.42 (1H, s), and 6.58 (1H, s).

## Purpose of the problem

Your first attempt at determining the structure of a natural product without any hints - not even a wrong structure.

## Suggested solution

The mass spectrum gives us the formula \( \left( {{\mathrm{C}}_{13}{\mathrm{H}}_{16}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}}\right) \) ,which looks like an aromatic compound as there are so few hydrogens,and the base peak at \( \mathrm{M} - {15} \) suggests that a methyl group is lost rather easily. The infrared suggests that all three oxygen atoms are present as ethers. The NMR shows us these details:

1.34 (6H,s): two identical methyl groups,probably \( {\mathrm{{CMe}}}_{2} \) . Rather large shift.

3.80 (3H, s) and 3.82 (3H, s): two different OMe groups.

\( {5.54}\left( {1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{d},{J10}\mathrm{\;{Hz}}}\right) \) and \( {6.37}\left( {1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{d},{J10}\mathrm{\;{Hz}}}\right) \) : two \( c \) is protons on an alkene.

\( {6.42}\left( {1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{s}}\right) \) and \( {6.58}\left( {1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{s}}\right) \) : two isolated protons on an aromatic ring,probably 1,4-related as there is no coupling. Rather small shifts - electron-rich ring.

If all this is true, we have these fragments.

<!-- Media -->

This adds up to \( {\mathrm{C}}_{13}{\mathrm{H}}_{16}{\mathrm{O}}_{2} \) ,so we have one more oxygen atom to fit in somewhere. It is very important that you now start to join up these fragments and see what you get. You quickly find that no chains of atoms are possible as there are not then enough substituents to go on the benzene ring (see the structure in the margin). We must find four substituents for the ring and there are only four other pieces to be joined up. The only chain-terminating units are the two OMe groups.

The five-membered ring is no good because the coupling constant between the alkene protons would be much smaller than 10 . The two six-membered rings are good because they make the benzene ring electron-rich (three OR substituents).

Purpose of the problem

Your second attempt at determining the structures of reaction products, now of moderate complexity.

## Suggested solution

Compound A contains the two reagents combined with the loss of HBr, and the four Hs at 6.74 and 7.18 p.p.m. suggest that the other reagent is attached to the benzene ring. The OMe group is still there (3H singlet at 3.72 p.p.m.) and the new signals are a coupled \( 6\mathrm{H} \) doublet and \( 1\mathrm{H} \) septuplet - an isopropyl group. The compound is one of these three isomers.

The correct isomer can be determined by the detailed NMR of the aromatic protons. They fall into two groups of \( 2\mathrm{H} \) each and each group is coupled with the other with a \( 9\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) coupling. This fits only with the para isomer. Both ortho and meta isomers have four different aromatic protons. Notice that we did this using the proton NMR only, but we might as well assign the other data.

Compound B combines the two reagents with the loss of \( {\mathrm{{Me}}}_{3}\mathrm{{Si}} \) and the gain of \( \mathrm{H} \) . Both the infrared and the \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR show the appearance of a second carbonyl group - the ester ( \( {1745}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) . 176 p.p.m.) has been joined by an aldehyde or ketone \( \left( {{1730}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1}}\right. \) ,202 p.p.m.). The proton NMR shows that it is an aldehyde(10.01,1H,s). There is also a \( {\mathrm{{CMe}}}_{2} \) group,but no longer part of ar. alkene (proton and carbon NMR also show that the alkene has gone) and the OMe group of the ester(4.3,3H,s). Finally,and very helpfully,there are two open-chain \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\mathrm{\;s} \) linked together (the two triplets with \( \mathrm{J}7\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) ). One of them (2.24 p.p.m.) is next to something and this has to be one of the carbonyl groups as there isn't anything else! So we have:

Though we mustn't say what 'ought to happen' we can still see that it makes more sense for the \( {\epsilon }^{ * } = {\epsilon }^{ * } \) group to stay where it is, on a chain of two carbon atoms, than mysteriously move to the other end the molecule next to the two methyl groups. This is not evidence, but we prefer the second structure Real evidence comes from the absence of coupling between the aldehyde proton and anything. If \( {\varepsilon }_{0} \) first structure were correct, the aldehyde proton would be a triplet. The second structure is right.

The \( {\mathrm{{NMe}}}_{2} \) group and the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}{\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) chain in the other reagent also survive so the oxygen atom of the alcohol has replaced the fluorine on the benzene ring.

From this alone, we can see an alkene with two Hs, a methyl group, and an isopropyl group. That A is up to \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{12} \) so we have found everything and we can join them up in two ways (yes,two - the there can be cis or trans!). There is also a puzzle over the \( J \) values - there are too many \( 5\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) couplings and the second \( {10}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) coupling is missing,but we’ll unravel that later.

- You will meet the reaction in Chapter 14.

The isopropyl group contains a \( 7\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) coupling between the two methyl groups and the \( \mathrm{H} \) at - 0 p.p.m. which is coupled to one of the alkene protons at 5.15 p.p.m. with \( J = 4\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) . The remaining coupling of the alkene proton at \( {5.15}\mathrm{p} \) .p.m.(10Hz)must be to the other alkene proton that fits with a \( c \) is double bond. Working from the other end,the methyl group at 1.60 p.p.m. is coupled to the alkene proton at 5.35 p.p.m. with \( J = 5\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) . Now we can solve the coupling constant - vstery. We know that the proton at 5.35 p.p.m. is actually a double quartet and that the doublet coupling happens to be exactly twice that within the quartet. So we have two 1:3:3:1 quartets the flapping so that the inner lines coincide and give six lines in the ratio 1:3:4:4:3:1. The compound - - is cis-4-methylpent-2-ene.

## Problem 2

Direct ester formation from alcohols \( \left( {{\mathrm{R}}^{1}\mathrm{{OH}}}\right) \) and carboxylic acids \( \left( {{\mathrm{R}}^{2}{\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H}}\right) \) works in acid solution but does not work at all in basic solution. Why not? By contrast, ester formation from alcohols \( \left( {{\mathrm{R}}^{1}\mathrm{{OH}}}\right) \) and carboxylic acid anhydrides, \( {\left( {\mathrm{R}}^{2}\mathrm{{CO}}\right) }_{2}\mathrm{O} \) ,or acid chlorides, \( \mathrm{{RCOCl}} \) ,is commonly carried out in the presence of amines such as pyridine or \( {\mathrm{{Et}}}_{3}\mathrm{\;N} \) . Why does this work?

## Purpose of the problem

This question may sound trivial but students starting organic chemistry often make the error of trying to form esters from carboxylic acids in basic solution. Thinking about the reasons may save you from the error.

## Suggested solution

The reaction works in acid solution because the carboxylic acid gets protonated and becomes a good electrophile. Later, the intermediate gets protonated again so that a molecule of water can be lost.

## Purpose of the problem

Drawing mechanisms for nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group with important compounds.

## Suggested solution

In the first reaction there are two nucleophilic substitutions and you must decide which nucleophile attacks first. The amine is a better nucleophile than the alcohol and the cyclization occurs because it is an equilibrium with two equal leaving groups (both alcohols) but one (EtOH) goes away when it leaves while the other is attached and cannot escape. The second reaction is more straightforward. The product is used to control the stereochemistry of new molecules as you will see in Chapter 45. For the first time we are using shorthand mechanisms. Note the double-headed arrow on the carbonyl group and the omission of proton transfer steps. If you drew the full mechanism, you did a better job. If you removed the amide(NH)proton before reaction with the acid chloride in the second step you also did a better job.

In basic solution, the first thing that happens is the removal of the acidic proton from the carboxylic acid. Nucleophiles will not now attack the carboxylate anion - the strongly nucleophilic aikoxide anion, in particular, will be repelled from another anion.

Acid anhydrides and chlorides do not have this acidic hydrogen so the alcohol attacks them readily and the base is helpful to remove a proton from the intermediate and encourage decomposition. The most popular bases are amines such as pyridine or \( {\mathrm{{Et}}}_{3}\mathrm{\;N} \) ,which are not strong enough to remove the proton from the alcohol before the reaction starts. The by-product from the uncatalysed reaction is \( \mathrm{{HCl}} \) (or \( {\mathrm{R}}^{ + }{\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) from an anhydride) and the base removes that.

## Purpose of the problem

A contrast between a very reactive (acid chloride), a less reactive (anhydride), and an unreactive (amide) carbonyl group.

## Suggested solution

The acid chloride reacts rapidly with water and the acid produced rapidly attacks another molecule of acid chloride. The anhydride reacts much more slowly \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}}}\right. \) of \( {\mathrm{{Cl}}}^{ - } \) is \( - 7,\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}} \) of \( {\mathrm{{RCO}}}_{2}^{ - } \) is about +5 ) with water so there is a good chance of stopping the reaction there especially when we add a low concentration of water in acetone solution. This chance is made a certainty because the solid anhydride precipitates from solution and is no longer in equilibrium with the other compounds. It is usually possible to descend the reactivity order of acid derivatives (text, p. 287).

The second reaction is an example of the alkaline hydrolysis of amides (see p. 293 of the text).

## The problem

The sequence of reactions where the first stops at the halfway stage but the second does not.

## agested solution

the carbonyl groups of the anhydride must be attacked by \( {\mathrm{{LiAlH}}}_{4} \) and we need to follow Section through to see what happens next. Before we do this it seems that the product, an

(txt). ester,must surely be reduced by the \( {\mathrm{{LiAlH}}}_{4} \) . The first addition of ’ \( \mathrm{H} - \) ’ produces a tetrahedral intermediate, which decomposes by the loss of the only leaving group, the carboxylate ion, to give an aldehyde. That too is quickly reduced to give the hydroxy-acid as its anion. Even \( {\mathrm{{LiAlH}}}_{4} \) attacks anions only very slowly so the hydroxy-acid remains until work-up when it cyclizes quickly to form the ester. When water is added,all the \( {\mathrm{{LiAlH}}}_{4} \) is instantly destroyed so none of it remains to reduce the ester.

The second reaction starts similarly with the Grignard reagent adding to the ester carbonyl and the tetrahedral intermediate losing the only possible leaving group, the alkoxide anion. Again, a reactive carbonyl compound is produced - a ketone that is more reactive than the original ester so a second Grignard addition occurs faster than the first. Work-up in aqueous acid gives the diol.

The amine attacks the ester in the usual way and the oxygen leaving group (the 'alcohol' is a phenol so \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}} \) is now about 10 ) is much better than the amine \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}}}\right. \) about 35 ) so the reaction will go this way. In acid solution, the mechanism is the same except that the nitrogen atom is protonated in the tetrahedral intermediate so the two leaving groups are about the same \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}}}\right. \) of phenol about \( {10},\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}} \) of aromatic amine about 8 ). What tips the balance is that one possible product is a weakly basic amide

- is not protonated under the reaction conditions, but the other is an amine and is protonated Section conditions. This removes it from the equilibrium and drives the reaction 'back'.

## Purpose of the problem

Explaining why reactions don't work may be the easist way to see how to make them work.

## Segested solution

The first two reactions are cases where the supposed electrophile (amide in the first case and ester in the - cond) is not reactive enough to combine wth the nucleophile. In the tetrahedral intermediates, the leaver leaving group is the one that has just been introduced (carboxylate in the first case and chloride The second) so the reactions could be made to work backwards but not in the direction given.

<!-- Media -->

The first reaction could be made to work by using the acid chloride instead of the amide. Howaride is a better leaving group than carboxylate. We cannot use this method in the second case as divide is the nucleophile. It is best to use the free acid instead of the ester and \( {\mathrm{{PCl}}}_{5} \) or \( {\mathrm{{SOCl}}}_{2} \) to the acid chloride.

The last example is rather different. The reaction will work - indeed it will work only too well! The product shown, with its two ketone groups, is more electrophilic than the original diester so it - react again and a diol will be formed.

## Problem 1

In the method for acetylating aromatic amines described in Chapter 8, p. 188 (the Lumière-Barbier method) the amine was dissolved in aqueous HCl. Using 1M amine, \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}{4.6} \) ,and 1M \( \mathrm{{HCl}},\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} - 7 \) ,what will be the approximate equilibrium constant in the reaction?

<!-- Media -->

It would be simpler not to add the sodium acetate,keeping the \( \mathrm{{pH}} \) low,and thus definitely keep all the amine in solution. Why is it necessary to raise the \( \mathrm{{pH}} \) for the second step of the reaction (the reaction with acetic anhydride)?

## Purpose of the problem

Simple revision of carbonyl addition from Chapter 6 with a bit of substitution added.

## Suggested solution

The answer to the first question is that the difference in \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) values is very great (11.6 - remember that this means a factor of \( {10}^{11.6} \) as it is a \( \log \) scale) and there is enough acid to protonate all the amine. The equilibrium constant is enormous.

In the second step,acetate ion \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}}}\right. \) about 5 ) and \( \mathrm{{HCl}}\left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} - 7}\right) \) set up an equilibrium with acetic acid and chloride ion. The difference in \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) values is still great and that equilibrium too will be right over on one side. However,the main point is that the \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \) values of acetic acid and \( {\mathrm{{PhNH}}}_{3}^{ + } \) are about the same so there will be about the same amount of each - the equilibrium constant will be about 1. Most of the amine will still be in solution as the cation but there will be enough free amine to react. If no sodium acetate were added, the amine would all be in solution as the cation and there would be essentially no free amine to act as a nucleophile. It would be simpler but no reaction: would occur.

why is the one more stable than the other? If you were to react an ester with acid, which of the two would you form and why?

## Propose of the problem

Emission of contribution of delocalization to structure, particularly of cations,

## Suggested solution

The positive charge on the left-hand cation is delocalized over both oxygen atoms but the positive charge in the right-hand intermediate is localized as there are no \( v \) electrons to be moved to the sensitively charged atom. If an ester is protonated it gives the more stable cation by protonation at method oxygen but we can use the other oxygen in the mechanism to show the delocalization.

So,if the available concentrations of \( \left\lbrack  {{\mathrm{R}}^{1}\mathrm{{OH}}}\right\rbrack   : \left\lbrack  {{\mathrm{R}}^{2}\mathrm{{OH}}}\right\rbrack \) are about 25,the ratio of esters must be about 25 the other way with a 25 -fold excess of \( {\mathrm{{MeCO}}}_{2}{\mathrm{R}}^{2} \) . The mixture contains about \( {96}\% \) \( {\mathrm{{MeCO}}}_{2}{\mathrm{R}}^{2} \) and about \( 4\% {\mathrm{{MeCO}}}_{2}{\mathrm{R}}^{1} \) .

## suggested solution

The hydroxide ion must attack the ketone to form a tetrahedral intermediate. The best leaving error up from this intermediate is the hydroxide ion that has just come in \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}}{15}}\right) \) rather than the skyne anion ( \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}} \) about 35). If we use the second hydroxide ion to deprotonate the intermediate - have only one possible leaving group, though it is a bad one, and the decomposition of the Tinion must be the rate-determining step. This mechanism is usually found for nucleophilic - bstitution at a carbonyl group with a very bad leaving group such as amide hydrolysis.

The first step is bimolecular and involves forming a new C-C bond. The second step is just 2 proton transfer between oxygen atoms and is certainly fast. The first step must be the rate-determining step and the intermediate will have a higher energy than the starting material or the product as it is an anion.

in the first reaction, uncharged starting materials form a partly charged transition state. A polar rent will stabilize the transition state and speed up the reaction. In the second case, a fully staged (zwitterionic) starting material gives a partly charged transition state. A polar solvent will the both starting material and transition state but it will stabilize the starting materials more. The energy gap \( \left( {\Delta {G}^{ \ddagger  }}\right) \) will increase and the reaction will go more slowly.

The third reaction is different because it has more than one step. It is a carbonyl substitution the kind we met in Chapter 12. The nucleophile (ammonia) attacks the carbonyl group to form tetrahedral intermediate that decomposes with the loss of the better leaving group.

We have marked two steps fast because they are just proton transfers between nitrogen oxygen atoms. Either of the other two steps might be rate-determining. In this substitutior. leaving group is relatively good (compare Problem 6) and the rate-determining step is the first - usual one for carbonyl substitutions. In this step, neutral starting materials become a direct (zwitterionic) intermediate so the transition state is becoming more charged and the reaction accelerated by more polar solvents.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

Practice at assessing the likely effect of acid and base on particular examples of equilibria.

## Suggested solution

The first example is an esterification (or lactonization as the product is a cyclic ester or lactone \( \rightarrow \) the forwards direction and an ester hydrolysis in the backwards direction. Ester hydrolysis 23 catalysed by acid or base but esterification by acid only. In addition, even a weak base will be enough to turn the starting material into the carboxylate anion, which will not cyclize. The equilibrium is to the right in acid solution and to the left in basic solution.

The second example is the familiar one of cyanohydrin formation from a ketone. The reaction is indeed reversible but in basic solution the cyanide anion is more stable than the oxyanion in the product and the carbonyl group is very stable too. In acidic solution (at pHs less than about 12) the oxyanion will be protonated and the reaction driven over to the right.

## Problem 11

<!-- Media -->

`C#CC.C1SSSSSSS1.S1SSS1`

<!-- Media -->

Practice at assessing the likely effect of entropy on equilibria.

## Suggested solution

The equilibrium position is determined both by enthalpy and entropy as discussed on p. 312 of the shapter. Entropy favours the larger number of molecules as they have greater randomness so heat will drive the equilibrium to the right. Enthalpy will favour the eight-membered ring as it has no ring strain and so lower temperatures favour the left-hand side.

Step 3 must be fast as it is just a proton transfer between oxygen atoms. The decomposition of the extrahedral intermediate is likely to be fast as the leaving group (carboxylate ion, \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}} \) about 5 ) is such a good one. The first step, the bimolecular attack of hydroxide on the anhydride, will be the tite-determining step. We need only draw the structures of the transition states and we can construct our diagram.

## Problem 1

In the cyclization of the open-chain form of glucose to form the stable hemiacetal, it may be difficult to work out what has happened.

## Purpose of the problem

First trial of a simple method to follow complicated looking reactions plus some revision of carbonyl addition reactions.

## Suggested solution

Just do what the question says! The starting material is numbered from the aldehyde group. We started numbering the product with \( \mathrm{C}6 \) as that is the only \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) group and then followed the carbon chain back to \( \mathrm{C}1 \) which is now the hemiacetal carbon.

<!-- Media -->

Numbering the carbon atoms makes it clear that the hydroxyl group on C5 has cyclized. To draw the mechanism, we need to redraw the starting material so that the reaction is possible and the easiest way to do that is to draw it like the product. Don't forget to change the thick and thin lines necessary when you flip a \( \mathrm{C} \) atom over! The mechanism is just a nucleophilic addition to the aldehyde as described in Chapter 6 and is the first step of the reactions in this chapter.

Enough methanol is formed in these reactions to make the final acetal and the water is consume in this process to give acetone as the other product. So both ketones and both acetals are i-equilibrium but the most volatile component is acetone and this is distilled off, driving the equilibrium over to the right.

The third example is essentially the same except that the reagent is one orthoester and the product is another. The volatile by-product is methanol and distillation of this pushes the equilibrium across. The mechanism is very similar to the first example with the formation methanol and an oxonium ion starting the process off. This time, an oxonium ion must be involved in the capture of each alcohol.

<!-- Media -->

The second example is different because no volatile by-product is removed and the position of equilibrium must represent a genuine difference in stabilities of the two acetals. Some water is needed as the first acetal must be wholly or partially hydrolysed and the water appears when the scond acetal is formed. The exact details of this mechanism are uncertain but the whole process is under thermodynamic control: the ketone is more stable than the aldehyde.

## Problem 7

In Chapter 6 we described how the antileprosy drug dapsone could be made soluble by the formation of a 'bisulfite adduct' Now that you know about the reactions described in Chapter 14, you should be able to draw a mechanism for this reaction.

## Purpose of the problem

Revision of chemistry from Chapter 6 with a challenging mechanistic problem - did you avoid the trap?

## Suggested solution

The trap is to go straight to the product by displacing hydroxide from the formaldehyde bisulfite adduct. Hydroxide is a very bad leaving group and reactions like this never occur.

<!-- Media -->

To avoid this trap we must use the chemistry from Chapters 6 and 14 - carbonyl chemistry. Reactions of the kind we need were used in Problem 5 where formaldehyde was also a reagent. First, we must make formaldehyde from its bisulfite adduct and then add it to the amino group of Japsone.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

Reminder of chemistry from this chapter - making acetals from ketones is difficult - and drawing a mechanism related to, but different from, one in Problem 4.

## Suggested solution

The equilibrium between a ketone and an alcohol on the one hand and the dimethyl acetal on the ther is unfavourable and must be driven over by devices such as this. The orthoformate is even more unstable than the acetal (three \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{O} \) bonds instead of two at the same carbon atom) and the Ester even more stable, because of conjugation, than the ketone. There are various mechanisms you might have drawn, which differ only in details such as the order of the steps. Here is one such.

<!-- Media -->

The first line shows the normal mechanism for acetal formation and points out the by-product, a molecule of water. This water is consumed in the hydrolysis of the orthoformate (by an acetal hydrolysis mechanism) to give a stable ordinary ester. The favourable second equilibrium pulls the first across to the right.

What are the two functional groups not affected by this reaction? How would you hydrolyse them?

## Purpose of the problem

Revision of the different types of acetals and their relative reactivity.

## Suggested solution

This question develops immediately from the last. The noncyclic acetal hydrolyses easily because the equilibrium favours the three molecules (one aldehyde and two alcohols). The two remaining acetals are a cyclic acetal or dioxolane and a cyclic dithioacetal or dithiane. The cyclic acetal just needs more vigorous acidic conditions but the dithiane needs a Lewis acid that likes sulfur. Mercury - Hg(II) - is a good example. The precise reagents and conditions are not important. Problem 10

## Purpose of the problem

Extension of acetal and aminal formation into examples where the intermediate is trapped by a different nucleophile.

## Suggested solution

The first reaction starts with the usual attack of an alcohol on an aldehyde but the second nucleophile is a carboxylic acid. Though a poor nucleophile, it is good enough to react with the oxonium ion, especially when the product is cyclic.

The second reaction starts with nucleophilic attack by the amine on the more electrophilic carbonyl group - the ketone. Imine formation is followed by cyclization and this second step is a normal nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group of an ester (Chapter 12). The imine double bond moves into the ring to secure conjugation with the ester.

## Purpose of the problem

Extension of the mechanism for acetal formation into dithioacetal (dithiane) formation.

## Suggested solution

The mechanism is a direct analogue of acetal formation. The dehydration step is more difficult because the \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{S} \) bond is less stable than the \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) bond because overlap of \( 2\mathrm{p} \) and \( 3\mathrm{p} \) orbitals is not as good as overlap of orbitals (for example, two 2ps) of the same size and energy.

## Problem 1

A compound \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{5}\mathrm{{FO}} \) has a broad peak in the infrared at about \( {3100} - {3400}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) and the following signals in its (proton decoupled) \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR spectrum. Suggest a structure for the compound and interpret the spectra.

\( {\delta }_{\mathrm{C}} \) (p.p.m.) 157.38 (doublet,coupling constant 229 Hz),151.24 (singlet),116.32 (doublet,coupling constant \( {7.5}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) ),116.02 (doublet,coupling constant \( {23.2}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) )

## Purpose of the problem

Just to remind you that coupling occurs in carbon spectra too and is useful.

## Suggested solution

All the signals are in the \( {\mathrm{{sp}}}^{2} \) region and two (at \( > {150} \) p.p.m.) are attached to electronegative elements. As the formula is \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6} \) ,a benzene ring is strongly suggested. The IR peak tells us we have ar. \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group so the compound is one of these.

<!-- Media -->

`C1=C(C=CC(=C1)O)F.C1=CC(=CC(=C1)F)O.C1=CC=C(C(=C1)F)O`

<!-- Media -->

The symmetry of the spectrum (only four signals) suggests the third compound as the other two would have six different carbon atoms in the ring. We can therefore assign the spectrum by saying that the very large coupling(229Hz)must be a \( {}^{2}{J}_{\mathrm{{CF}}} \) and the zero coupling must be the carbon attached to the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) . The other two signals are the carbons in between and we can assume that,the larger the coupling, the nearer the carbon is to fluorine.

## "-- pose of the problem

Aersion of Chapter 11 and the first example of total structure determination.

## _____gested solution

that tarting material for \( 2\mathrm{\;A} \) is \( {\mathrm{C}}_{7}{\mathrm{H}}_{12}{\mathrm{O}}_{3} \) and has apparently lost an oxygen atom. As the reagent is it is more likely to have gained two hydrogen atoms and lost a water molecule. The IR shows a \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) group and suggests an ester or a strained ketone. The NMR shows two 3 \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) groups,one (at 2.51 p.p.m.) next to a functional group but not oxygen,so presumably 1 the intact \( {\mathrm{{CMe}}}_{2} \) group,and an isolated \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) group next to oxygen at 3.9 p.p.m.. There is only the asonable structure.

<!-- Media -->

The mass spectrum of compound 2B shows that it has chlorine in it, the IR shows a CN group, the proton NMR shows eight Hs. If we assume that no C atoms have been lost,the most able formula is \( {\mathrm{C}}_{5}{\mathrm{H}}_{8}\mathrm{{ClNS}} \) . The compound has lost a water molecule. The proton NMR three linked \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) groups,a quintet in the middle,and two triplets at the ends. The shifts of the terminal \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\mathrm{\;s} \) (2.5 and 2.9 p.p.m.) show that they are next to functional groups but not \( \mathrm{{Cl}} \) is no oxygen in the molecule). This must mean that we have a unit: \( - {\mathrm{{SCH}}}_{2}{\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}{\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\mathrm{{CN}} \) . All remains is an isolated \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) group with a large shift and the chlorine atom so they must be 1. to S. The large shift (4.9 p.p.m.) comes from \( {1.5} + 1\left( \mathrm{\;S}\right)  + 2\left( \mathrm{{Cl}}\right)  = {4.5} \) p.p.m. Again one - - - - emerges.

## 3-1-pose of the problem

Step thinking the other way round - from structure to data. What are the important pieces of same?

## Segested solution

" are many acceptable ways in which you could answer this question ranging from choosing the vital statistic for each pair to analysing all the data for each compound. We'll adopt a Steven way and point out several important distinctions. In the first example, one main difference is string size,seen mainly in the IR. Both are esters (about \( {1745}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) ) but we should add \( {30}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) the five-membered ring. The functional group next to the \( {\mathrm{{OCH}}}_{2} \) group is different - an \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) There are and an ester in the other. There are other differences.

In the second case there are also differences in the IR \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) stretch between the aldehyde (about \( {1730}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) ) and the conjugated ketone (about \( {1680}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) ) but the main difference is in the proton NMR. The aldehyde proton and the number of protons next to oxygen make a clear distinction. There will also be differences in the \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) and \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR spectra of the benzene rings since one is conjugated with a \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) group and the other is not. The reaction actually gives a mixture.

## Purpose of the problem

Further thinking the other way round - from structure to data. Contrasting the limitations of IR and \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR with the data from \( {}^{1}\mathrm{H} \) NMR spectra.

## Suggested solution

The molecular formula of the compounds varies so mass spectra would also be useful, but in the IR the compounds with an \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group would show a strong broad \( \mathrm{U} \) -shaped band at above \( {3000}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) The cyclic ester would have a \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) stretch at about \( {1775}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) ,the ketones a band at about \( {1715}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) ,and the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) group a broad band at about \( {1715}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) as well as a very broad V-shaped band from 2500 to \( {3500}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) . In the \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR the ester and acid would have a carbonyl group at about 170-180 p.p.m. but the ketones would have one at about 200 p.p.m. The number and position of the other signals would also vary.

Al. have a \( 6\mathrm{H} \) singlet,for the \( {\mathrm{{CMe}}}_{2} \) group in all cases except the second where it is the two identical COMe groups. The last has an isolated Me group. The \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) and \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) protons might show up as broad signals at any chemical shift.

## pose of the problem

## sested solution

## Purpose of the problem

The other important kind of structure determination: compounds isolated from a chemice reaction.

## Suggested solution

Compound \( 7\mathrm{\;A} \) is much the simpler so we start with that. The two reagents are \( {\mathrm{C}}_{5}{\mathrm{H}}_{6}{\mathrm{O}}_{4} \) and \( {\mathrm{C}}_{5}{\mathrm{H}}_{8}{\mathrm{O}}_{2} \) which adds up to \( {\mathrm{C}}_{10}{\mathrm{H}}_{14}{\mathrm{O}}_{6} \) or 230 so 60 has been lost. That looks like \( {\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{4}{\mathrm{O}}_{2} \) or less likely \( {\mathrm{C}}_{3}{\mathrm{H}}_{8}\mathrm{O} \) (because it is saturated). If the first is right, \( 7\mathrm{\;A} \) is \( {\mathrm{C}}_{8}{\mathrm{H}}_{10}{\mathrm{O}}_{4} \) which at least fits the proton NMR.

The IR suggests two carbonyl groups,though the \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR suggests one only,but the molecule must have some symmetry as there are only five signals for eight carbon atoms. The proton NMS shows a \( {\mathrm{{CMe}}}_{2} \) group and four identical protons,which can only be two identical \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) groups. The only unsaturation is the two carbonyl groups so the \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) signal at 105 p.p.m. is very strange. It,like-the signal at 22 p.p.m., is probably a quaternary carbon as it is weak and it must be next to two oxygen atoms to have such a large shift. Either 22 or 105 p.p.m. must be C of \( {\mathrm{{CMe}}}_{2} \) . The last two: degrees of unsaturation must be rings. The cyclopropane would supply one ring and the two links: and symmetrical \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) groups and the carbon at 22 p.p.m. would be the atom joining that ring to the two carbonyl groups leaving 105 p.p.m. to be \( \mathrm{C} \) of \( {\mathrm{{CMe}}}_{2} \) . So we have:

That actually accounts for all the atoms so 7A must be what you get when you join these two - zements together. The carbonyls are arranged rather like those in acyclic anhydride and the two as stretches must be the symmetrical and antisymmetrical combinations.

Compound 7B has nitrogen in it (odd MW) and clearly has the benzene ring too from the NMR we can put down PhN \( \left( { = {91}}\right) \) as part of the structure. It also has two carbonyl groups (in IR,the and at \( {1670}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) looks like an amide) and they are both acid derivatives \( \left( {{}^{13}\mathrm{C}\text{NMR}}\right) \) . There are fitted aliphatic carbons,two \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\mathrm{\;s} \) and one \( \mathrm{{CH}} \) . Adding these together gives us \( {\mathrm{C}}_{11}{\mathrm{H}}_{10}{\mathrm{{NO}}}_{2} = {188} \) so that is 17 missing which looks like \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) . Since we need a second acid derivative and the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) is the remaining heteroatom,it must be a carboxylic acid. Given that the \( \mathrm{{CH}} \) is a triplet,it must be text to one of the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\mathrm{\;s} \) and,as they are both multiplets,they must be joined to each other. There is the more degree of unsaturation so there is a ring. So we have:

<!-- Media -->

To assemble three fragments into a molecule we must plug the amide into the \( {\mathrm{C}}_{3} \) fragment to the a ring and put the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) group on the last free position. We can do this in two ways. Proton NMR distinguishes these. The end \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) is attached either to the nitrogen atom minated 3.2 p.p.m.) or to the carbonyl group (estimated 2.2 p.p.m.) of the amide. The derived value of 3.92 p.p.m. fits the first better. A similar estimate for the \( \mathrm{{CH}} \) also suggests the structure. This is indeed the correct answer.

## Purpose of the problem

Further practice at structure determination, adding ideas of the size of the coupling constant.

## Suggested solution

The compound is an epoxide: the coupling constants around the ring are small \( (3\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) ,contrast \( {10}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) in the benzene ring) because of ring size and the electronegative oxygen atom. All the \( \mathrm{{Hs}} \) in the Ph group happen to come at the same shift but those in the nitrated ring are at lower field anc separated by the \( {\mathrm{{NO}}}_{2} \) group.

## Purpose of the problem

Structure determination of reaction products by proton NMR alone with extra twists - an element with spin (P) and protons on the same carbon atom that are different in the NMR.

## Suggested solution

The coupling constants \( \left( {{}^{3}{J}_{\mathrm{{PH}}}}\right) \) across the double bond in \( {12}\mathrm{\;A} \) are very large. Typically \( {cis}{}^{3}{J}_{\mathrm{{PH}}} \) is about \( {20}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) and trans \( {}^{3}{J}_{\mathrm{{PH}}} \) is about \( {40}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) . Geminal \( \left( {{}^{2}{J}_{\mathrm{{PH}}}}\right) \) coupling constants are also large but more variable. In 12B there is a stereogenic centre so that the hydrogen atoms and methyl groups i.e. the ring are either on the same side as \( \mathrm{{MeO}} \) or the same side as \( \mathrm{{Ph}} \) . They are diastereotopic with different chemical shifts and the Hs couple \( \left( {{}^{2}J}\right) \) . We cannot say which is which.

Carrying out the procedure given in the chapter (p. 387) we label the substituents 1-4 and deduced the configuration. In all these case,‘ 4 ’ is \( \mathrm{H} \) and goes at the back when we work out \( R \) or \( S \) . The firs: compound is 'Pirkle's reagent' used to check the purity of enantiomers. The second is the natural amino acid cysteine and is \( R \) because \( \mathrm{S} \) ranks higher than \( \mathrm{O} \) . The third is natural citronellal.

## Problem 2

If a solution of a compound has a rotation of +12 , how could you tell if this was actually +12, or really -348, or +372?

## Purpose of the problem

Revision of the meaning of rotation and what it depends on.

## Suggested solution

Check in the chapter (p. 389) to see the equation that states that the rotation depends on three things: the rotating power of the molecule, the length of the cell used in the polarimeter, and the concentration of the solution. We can't change the first, we may be able to change the second, but the third is easiest to change. If we halve the concentration,the rotation will change to \( + 6, - {174} \) , +186 . That is not quite good enough as those last two figures are the same. Any other change in concentration will do the trick. 16

## Problem 3

Corella's glass slipper was undoubtedly a chiral object. But would it have rotated the : are of polarized light?

## pose of the problem

on of the cause of rotation and optical activity.

## agested solution

The macroscopic shape of the object is irrelevant. Only the molecular structure matters as light with the electrons in the molecules. Glass is not chiral (usually made up of inorganic states these days). Only if the slipper had been made of a single enantiomer of a transparent three would it have rotated polarized light.

## 2-rpose of the problem

repreement of the very important criterion for chirality. The previous problems were almost rish compared with this one; make sure you understand the answer.

## Suggested solution

"" one thing matters - does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? We need to redraw some of term to see if they do. On no account look for chiral centres or carbon atoms with four different - s or whatever. Just look for a plane of symmetry.

The first compound has been drawn with the carboxylic acid represented in two different ways as a false chiral centre drawn at the top. The two \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) groups are,in fact,the same and the - scule has a plane of symmetry.

The last molecule is an interesting case. It is chiral but, if you got this one wrong, don't be too disappointed. Again,making a model will help but the vital thing is to realize that the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) group is on a tetrahedral centre so the ring itself is not a plane of symmetry. The alkene puts the phenyl group to one side and a hydrogen atom to the other so the plane at right angles to the ring (dotted line) isn't a plane of symmetry either.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

Revision of the criterion for chirality with examples of the main classes of chiral molecules. Exam-style question.

## Suggested solution

Molecules are chiral if they have no plane of symmetry. This may arise from a tetrahedral atom with four different substituents or from a molecule that is forced to adopt a shape that lacks a plane of symmetry. Examples include spiro compounds, axial chirality in allenes, chiral C, P, S, etc. You should give definite examples in this part of the answer, which are different from those given in the question. Ask someone to check if yours are all right.

The phosphorus compound does not have a chiral phosphorus atom but the molecule is chiral because it is a spiro compound like the second molecule in the last question. The second molecule is Planar but the combination of a double bond and a tetrahedral centre at the other ring reaction removes all possibility of a plane of symmetry. This too is chiral.

The third molecule tries to look chiral but it is almost planar because of conjugation, and the #Segen atom above the plane reflects the hydrogen atom below it. The plane of the ring is a plane metry and the molecule is not chiral. The fourth molecule is an allene with the two alkenes gonal to each other. It needs to be drawn more realistically to show that there is a plane of - metry cutting the cyclohexane ring at right angles and passing through the methyl group on the ther end of the allene. Not chiral either.

## Purpose of the problem

Combining mechanisms with stereochemical analysis for the first time.

## Suggested solution

We need a mechanism for each reaction, a stereochemical description for each starting material example, chiral?, enantiomerically enriched?), and an analysis of what has happened to stereochemistry during the reaction. Don't forget: you can't get enantiomers out of nothing - everything that goes into a reaction is racemic or achiral, so is the product.

(a) The starting material is achiral (the two side chains are of equal length) but the product is child. It cannot be enantiomerically enriched because the starting materials and reagents are achiral. stereochemistry is defined in the first step: if one \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) cyclizes you get one enantiomer and,if the other, the other.

(b) The starting material is achiral and the product is chiral but this time the reagent (the enzyme undoubtedly chiral! The actual reducing agent will be a dihydropyridine bound to the enzyme: shall get one enantiomer of the product, though we cannot deduce which as differ:- dehydrogenase enzymes have different stereoselectivities. : The starting material is chiral but racemic and the reagent is achiral.

Reaction (b) is more tricky. The two compounds are isomeric and the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group is part The an ester in the product so it makes sense to attack the carbonyl group with the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) as deptic. The Ts group (toluene-para-sulfonyl) on nitrogen makes it a better leaving group an oxyanion so the reaction proceeds.

The first two compounds (methyls cis) are obviously different diastereoisomers and both have a plane of symmetry so neither is chiral. The second pair (methyls trans) are slightly more tricky - they are the same! And this isomer does not have a plane of symmetry and is chiral. In fact this is like the last example in Problem 11. There are three diastereoisomers and only one of them is chiral.

Reduction of a double bond by catalytic hydrogenation puts two hydrogen atoms on the same side of the alkene. This can give only the first two compounds but we might expect hydrogen to add more easily to the side of the alkene opposite the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) group. Our prediction is:

We start with all the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) groups on one side and gradually move them over,we should get the that answer. If you got too many diastereoisomers, check that some of yours aren't the same as stars. There are eight diastereoisomers altogether and, incredibly, all except one are achiral.

## Suggested solution

The electrophile in example (a) is the methyl group of the sulfonate ester and the nucleophile is a sulfur anion formed by deprotonation of \( \mathrm{{PhSH}}\left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}}\right. \) about 7) by \( \mathrm{{NaOH}}\left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}}}\right. \) about 16).

## Purpose of the problem

How to choose between the \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}1 \) or \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) mechanism when the choice is more subtle.

## Suggested solution

Carbonate is a strong enough base to remove protons from phenols \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}}\right. \) about 10 ) but not from alcohols. One oxyanion will be formed at a time and will displace a bromide ion in an \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) reaction. It doesn’t matter which goes first. Both react by the \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) mechanism because one is primary and the other, though secondary, is next to a carbonyl group and the cation would be very unstable while the \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) mechanism is excellent.

The two reactions are an \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) at primary carbon and a nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl Subsp with the amino group as the nucleophile in both cases. Substitution at the carbonyl group 5 bably happens first. Don’t worry if you didn’t draw the deprotonation of the amide and the \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) Each of nitrogen exactly as we did.

- imple (a) offers a choice between an Sv2 reaction at a tertiary carbon atom or an Sv1 reaction next to - 5 - 5 only group. In fact,these are about the only known examples of \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) reactions at tertiary carbon \( \rightarrow \) work because the carbonyl group accelerates \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) reactions so much. The diagram of the transition shows how the \( \mathrm{p} \) orbitals on the carbonyl group are parallel to the \( \mathrm{p} \) orbital in the \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) transition Azide is also an excellent nucleophile being sharp and narrow and not affected much by steric the theore.

Examples (c) and (d) add the same group (PrO) to the same starting material (an epoxide) under Secrent conditions. We can tell that (c) must be \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}1 \) because the nucleophile has added to the --> rather than the secondary end of the epoxide and that (d) must be \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) because of the reverse - selectivity. Acid catalysis makes \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}1 \) better by improving the leaving group and base catalysis 3 . Let \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) better by improving the nucleophile. Notice that inversion of configuration occurs in reactions. This is expected in \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) and may be the case in \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}1 \) because the underside of the is not blocked by the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group. If you said that inversion implied \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) with a loose cationic activition state, you may well be right as this is also a valid explanation.

## sested solution

Laur drawings may look different from ours but make sure the rings have parallel sides and don't "ab upstairs". Make sure that the axial bonds are vertical and the equatorial bonds parallel to the =-ring-bond-but-one. The first molecule has a free choice so it puts both substituents equatorial.

## Suggested solution

Cyclohexyl bromide has the chair conformation with the bromine atom equatorial. It cannot do an E2 reaction (Chapter 19) in this conformation as \( \mathrm{E}2 \) requires the reacting \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{H} \) and \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{{Br}} \) bonds to be anti-periplanar. This can be achieved if the molecule first flips to an unfavourable axial conformation.

## Purpose of the problem

Since this is a multistep mechanism, it is best to draw the mechanism first before considering conformation.

<!-- Media -->

In the deprotonation step, the axial proton will be lost, though this doesn't affect the conformation of the molecule. In the elimination step the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group must be axial so that the \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{C} \) bond is parallel to the \( \mathrm{p} \) orbitals in the \( \pi \) system. The molecule is a cis-decalin so it has a choice of conformations. Don't be disheartened if you got the wrong conformation first time - we took several tries before getting it right. Problem 6

Confirming the conformations experimentally means measuring coupling constants in the ton NMR so we need to look at the vital protons (marked ’H’ on the diagrams below) and receive whether they can be seen in the spectrum. Fortunately, the interesting protons are all next conclusional groups so they can be seen. We probably can't see the axial proton at the ring junction The first example but trans-decalins must have axial protons there, so that is not so important.

By contrast,the two equatorial \( \mathrm{{Hs}} \) in the second compound have each got two axial and two equatorial neighbours (not shown) and all the coupling constants will be the same. They will both appear as narrow triplets of triplets. The two axial protons in the third example have each got two axial and two equatorial neighbours (one pair shown) and will appear again as approximate tts, but this time one triplet will have a large axial/axial coupling constant.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

Exploration of the effect of conformation on equilibria in thermodynamically controlled reactions.

## Suggested solution

The mechanism of these reaction is normal acetal formation as described in Chapter 14 and is irrelevant to this question as we are dealing only with stabilities in this thermodynamically controlled reaction. We need to look at the conformations of the molecules.

<!-- Media -->

Axial groups in the ketones are not very important as there is no 1,3-diaxial interaction with the ketone itself. But 1,3-diaxial interactions with the acetal are bad because one of the the acetal oxygen atoms has to be axial. Though the ketone \( \mathbf{{8A}} \) is slightly less stable than \( \mathbf{{8B}} \) ,the acetal of \( \mathbf{{8A}} \) is much less stable than the acetal of \( \mathbf{{8B}} \) .

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

Practice at choosing the correct regiochemistry of a conformationally controlled epoxide opening.

## Suggested solution

The opening of cyclohexene epoxides is controlled by the need to get trans diaxial products. This is the reverse of the reaction discussed in Problem 6 and is described in full in the text on pp. 468-70. """ get the right answer we need merely to draw the only possible trans diaxial product from each of use conformationally fixed trans-decalins. Cyanide must, of course, open the epoxide with exersion so the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group in the products is on the same side as the original epoxide.

## Eurpose of the problem

Fig 2 a pay your skill in a deceptive example of control of alkene geometry by elimination.

## suggested solution

The first reaction is a stereospecific cis addition of hydrogen to the alkyne to give a cis-alkene. The mermediate is therefore a cis, cis-diene and it seems remarkable that it should turn into a trans, - - : s-diene on elimination. However, when we draw the mechanism for the elimination we see that

there need be no relationship between the stereochemistry of the two compounds as this is an E1 - Even after conversion to the reaction, and the stable and therefore long-lived intermediate cation can rotate into the most stable dienal, reversible conjugate addition of water would allow cis/trans the before conversion to the ketone. interconversion.

<!-- Media -->

The second reaction is also E1cB and so the alkene must end up conjugated with the carbony: group. The stereochemistry is irrelevant as this is not an E2 reaction and there is no requirement for \( \mathrm{H} \) and \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) to be anti-planar.

## Purpose of the problem

A more complicated electrophilic addition with questions of stability and selectivity added.

## Suggested solution

One of the double bonds in the diene reacts in the usual way first of all to give the monoepoxide. Two questions then arise. If the reaction can be made to stop there, the monoalkene must be less nucleophilic than the diene. This is so because the HOMO reacts. The HOMO of an alkene is just the populated \( \pi \) orbital. The HOMO of a diene is \( {\Psi }^{2} \) resulting from the antibonding addition of the two separate \( \pi \) orbitals and is less stable than either \( \pi \) orbital.

<!-- Media -->

The other question is why work at low temperature and buffer the solution? The low temperature favours the kinetic product and discourages the slower second epoxidation. A by-product from epoxidation is the acid \( {\mathrm{{RCO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) and there is a danger that this may catalyse opening of the monoepoxide to give the allyl cation in the frame. A buffer prevents the solution from becoming too acidic.

The anion \( {\mathrm{{ClO}}}^{ - } \) cannot be an electrophile: one protonation makes it neutral \( \mathrm{{HOCl}} \) but it becomes electrophilic enough to attack an alkene only after a second protonation. Attack of the chlorine enc of \( {\mathrm{{ClOH}}}_{2}^{ + } \) evidently occurs from underneath the alkene,presumably because the two substituents (Me and AcO) are on the top surface. Attack by water must then be from the opposite (top) face but why does it occur at the less substituted carbon? This is a conformational question: we must get the trans diaxial product for the correct alignment of orbitals (Chapter 18).

\[{}^{ \ominus  }\text{OCl}\xrightarrow[]{\text{ HOAc }}\text{HOCl}\xrightarrow[]{\text{ HOAc }}{\mathrm{H}}_{2}\overset{ \oplus  }{0} - \mathrm{{Cl}}\]

first reaction must surely be electrophilic addition of chlorine. One possibility is that the - lororide is formed but then undergoes E1 elimination via the very stable tertiary and doubly Specific cation. Another possibility is that the addition to this very reactive and unsymmetrical _____ in) and not via a three-membered ring intermediate.

## Furpose of the problem

- sion of Chapter 14 (acetal formation and hydrolysis) and elimination (Chapter 19) together - two reactions from this chapter: epoxidation and conformationally controlled opening of an while on a six-membered ring (see also Chapter 18).

## suggested solution

The full mechanisms for acetal formation (step 1) and hydrolysis (step 4) and for epoxidation \( \approx  2 \) ) have appeared so often that we shall not repeat them. See Chapter 14 and this chapter if you have some doubts. The epoxidation occurs from the bottom face of the ring because the axial methyl group blocks the top face of the alkene (see also Problem 9, this chapter). Ring opening with HF gives the trans diaxial product. The elimination to give an enone is by the E1cB mechanism. The \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group is axial and so is easily lost.

## Purpose of the problem

Drawing a mechanism for a bromination with an internal nucleophile and revision of NMR.

## Suggested solution

The mechanism is formation of the bromonium ion and nucleophilic attack by the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group at the more substituted carbon atom. The NMR spectrum shows that the protons next to Br \( \left( {\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{a}}\right) \) and oxygen \( \left( {\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{b}}\right) \) are both axial: the \( \mathrm{{Br}} \) atom and the methyl group must therefore be equatorial.

The second compound has the special 1,3- Elationship between two carbonyl groups that gives a very stable conjugated enol.

Acid anhydrides,being carbonyl electrophiles with polarized \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) bonds,respond to charge density (they are 'hard' electrophiles) and react well with oxygen nucleophiles. Bromine, by contrast, is uncharged and unpolarized (it is a 'soft' electrophile) and reacts well with neutral nucleophiles such as alkenes (Chapter 20). Each electrophile reacts regioselectively with the part of the enol that suits it best.

## Purpose of the problem

Transion of the material of Chapter 13 to enol chemistry.

## ggested solution

meed to draw the mechanism out in full with no short cuts. It has four steps (A-D). Steps A and - merely proton transfers between oxygen atoms and cannot be slow. The rate-determining step be either B or C. If the rate is not proportional to the concentration of bromine, then the rate- - mining step must be B - a step before bromine gets involved. Step B is also just a proton This is eroster, but the proton is being removed from a carbon atom and this can be slow.

Aklavinone has again two aromatic rings, one definitely nonaromatic ring (D), and one (B) that we might argue about. However, try as you may you can't get six electrics into ring B (one extreme delocalized version is shown). 'Tetracycline' because of the four rings

## Purpose of the problem

A more quantitative assessment of the relative reactivities of the various positions in an aromatic \( = \mathrm{g} \) .

## suggested solution

There are two ortho and two meta sites but only one para site so the ratio would be \( 2 : 2 : 1 \) o:m:p if were equally reactive. It is actually 30:2:37 or 15:1:18 or 43:3:54 depending on how you recessed it. The ortho and para positions are roughly equally reactive because the alkyl group is electron-donating. The para is slightly more reactive than the ortho because of steric hindrance. The is an order of magnitude less reactive because the intermediate cation is not so stabilized by - conjugation from the methyl group. Problem 5

The main product, C, comes from the addition of both these electrophiles, but which adds first? The ketone in A is meta-directing but the \( t \) -butyl group in B is para-directing. Product C has a par.. relationship and must come from Friedel-Crafts acylation of B with the acylium cation.

<!-- Media -->

We have now answered the question but you might like to go a stage further. Both A and C are formed with alkylation of benzene as the first step. The decomposition of the acylium ion is evidently faster than the acylation of benzene. However, when B reacts further, it is mainly acylated (only a small amount of di- \( t \) -butyl benzene is formed). Evidently,the decomposition of the acylium ion is slower than the acylation of \( \mathrm{B} \) ! This is not,in fact,unreasonable as the \( t \) -Bu group in B accelerates electrophilic attack - it is just a dramatic demonstration of that acceleration.

## Purpose of the problem

Revision of NMR and an attempt to convince you that the principles of Chapter 22 can easily applied to molecules you haven't met before.

## Suggested solution

The two \( 2\mathrm{H} \) triplets and the broad \( \mathrm{{NH}} \) show that the saturated ring is intact so one nitro group been added to the benzene ring. The proton at 7.81 p.p.m. with only one small (meta) coup-must be between the nitro group and the ring and is marked in each structure. There are \( \tau \) possible structures.

<!-- Media -->

Though both \( \mathrm{{NH}} \) and \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) are ortho,para-directing,we should expect \( \mathrm{{NH}} \) to win as it has a local pair of electrons. This would favour the first structure, but is not evidence. Calculation of the expected chemical shifts of protons in the two structures gives a more reliable answer. For example, the two marked hydrogen atoms are predicted to come at:

<!-- Media -->

<table><tr><td>Proton</td><td>ortho-</td><td>ortho-</td><td>meta-</td><td>Predicted \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) (p.p.m.</td></tr><tr><td>\( {\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{a}} \) at \( {7.27} + \)</td><td>\( {\mathrm{{NO}}}_{2} =  + {0.95} \)</td><td>\( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} =  - {0.14} \)</td><td>\( \mathrm{{NH}} =  - {0.25} \)</td><td>7.73</td></tr><tr><td>\( {\mathrm{H}}^{ \circ  } \) at \( {7.27} + \)</td><td>\( {\mathrm{{NO}}}_{2} =  + {0.95} \)</td><td>\( \mathrm{{NH}} =  - {0.75} \)</td><td>\( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} =  - {0.06} \)</td><td>7.31</td></tr></table>

<!-- Media -->

The observed value of 7.81 p.p.m. clearly fits \( {\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{a}} \) better than \( {\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{b}} \) . The main difference between \( \dot{w} \) : two comes from the \( \mathrm{{NH}} \) group and the result favours the compound predicted from the expected mechanism. This one is correct.

No Lewis acid is needed in (a) as the ring is activated and the reaction is me colar,whereas in (b) the ring is weakly activated by \( i - \mathrm{{Pr}} \) ,more strongly deactivated by the group, and the reaction is intermolecular.

The acylation is a straightforward nucleophilic substitution at the carbonyl group and the \( {\mathrm{{CF}}}_{3}\mathrm{C} \) group is chosen to make the anion at nitrogen more stable.

## Purpose of the problem

## Suggested solution

The first step is surprising but simple. Electrophilic attack occurs in the para position to the activating \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group. The intermediate cannot lose a proton from the tetrahedral centre so it loses the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) proton instead. The phenol would rather lose its aromaticity than react in the meta position.

agate addition of the nucleophile is possible because of the nitro group. After the first tution the compound gains extra stabilization from conjugation of the amino and the nitro as (in frame in margin). This conjugation is interrupted during the second substitution so it is - but follows the same mechanism.

## Suggested solution

We want to introduce both \( \mathrm{{CN}} \) and \( {\mathrm{{NH}}}_{2} \) as nucleophiles but the ring is unactivated so we must use P-E cial methods. The most obvious are a benzyne route for the amine and a diazonium route for the matrile.

In the second example, the electrophile is an anhydride with two reactive carbonyl groups that nearly but not quite the same. This is a recipe for bad selectivity - reaction will occur at carbonyls.

## Purpose of the problem

Simpler examples of chemoselectivity between different carbonyl groups.

## Suggested solution

---

These examples come from work by K. Soai et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., 1982, 1282 and by C. F. Nutaitis and G. W. Gribble, Tetrahedron Lett., 1983, 24, 4287.

---

There are three carbonyl groups in the first compound: a ketone, and ester, and an amide. Reaction in the same order (ketone \( > \) ester \( > \) amide) but the ketone and amide groups are on adjacent \( < \) atoms ( \( \alpha \) -keto-amide) so both are more reactive than normal. The ketone is the most reactive: esters amides are not usually reduced by \( {\mathrm{{NaBH}}}_{4} \) . The second example has a ketone and an aldehyce aldehyde is more reactive. If we used \( {\mathrm{{NaBH}}}_{4} \) as the reagent it would probably reduce both,so the reactive modified borohydride \( \mathrm{{NaB}}{\left( \mathrm{{OAc}}\right) }_{3}\mathrm{H} \) ,sodium triacetoxyborohydride,is used instead.

## Suggested solution

We need to reduce the first ester,convert the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group to an \( \mathrm{{SH}} \) ,couple it with a two-carb-electrophilic fragment such as an epoxide,and convert \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) to \( {\mathrm{{NH}}}_{2} \) . The plan is something on these line

## Purpose of the problem

An exercise in choosing good routes to simple compounds.

## Suggested solution

You will be making \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{O} \) bonds in making these ethers and the choice hinges on which \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{O} \) bond you think can be made more easily or without selectivity problems. In the first case either route will do: the aromatic substitution is all right because of the para-nitro group and an epoxide can be use as the electrophile in the alternative.

Whichever way you make the second ether, you will have to react an allylic alcohol with an allylic halide. There is no problem with the allylic alcohol, but we need to be sure that the allylic halide will react at the right end. Compound A has two sites for attack marked with a black blob. Attack at either leads to the same product (work it out for yourselves!). In compound B they are different but attack at the primary centre will be much preferred. Either route is fine. In both cases we now know that we can choose either route because we have analysed them mechanistically.

In both cases we must consider the danger of enolate formation from the ketone. In the first case the alcohol might displace the bromide or attack the ketone and in the second the allylic bromide might be attacked at the alkene though this makes no difference as the allylic system is symmetrical. The first approach is easier as the bromoketone is easily made from acetone (Chapter 21) and the allylic halide in the second approach would probably be made from the alcohol used in the first synthesis.

Several problems in this chapter ask you to suggest ways to carry out conversions of one molecule into another or just to make a molecule. We give one possible answer and sometimes comment on alternatives but you should realize that there are many possible right answers to this sort of question. Make sure you have understood the principles behind each question and, if your answer is different from ours, check it with someone who knows.

ine is formed by nucleophilic attack on the ketone and elimination of water.

We give one possible answer and sometimes comment on alternatives but you should realize that there are many possible right answers to this sort of question. Make sure you have understood the principles behind each question and, if your answer is different from ours, check it with someone who knows.

## Suggested solution

Only one compound can form an enolate and only one compound (the same) can be : electrophile. The ketone can lose a proton from either side but it can produce an er-only if the enolate is formed into the methyl group. The elimination is again by the \( E = 1 \) mechanism.

## Purpose of the problem

Extending the last problem so that you look at the aldol reaction as a way to make unsaturation carbonyl compounds.

## Suggested solution

Just find the conjugated alkene and 'see' the enolate there. In the first case, cyclohexanone prove two enolates to react with two molecules of unenolizable benzaldehyde.

In the second case, two aldol-style reactions must be used, one after the other. The end-required for the first aldol is an aldehyde but, for the second, an acid derivative must be used as - the best is probably malonic acid so that no hydrolysis is needed and decarboxylation occurs upto the conditions of the reaction.

## Suggested solution

The aldol reaction appears to have taken place but there has been reduction of the ketone product.

Purpose of the problem

Revision of compound identification, especially NMR, in the context of the aldol reaction.

## Suggested solution

The IR suggests a simple ketone, or possibly an aldehyde, but there is no aldehyde proton at 9-10 p.p.m. so it must be a ketone. The NMR shows an alkene with large chemical shifts (7.3 8.8) suggesting that it is conjugated with the ketone. The coupling constant(5.5Hz)is very far too small for a trans alkene and small even for a cis alkene so it must be in a ring. The group is still there and the \( 2\mathrm{H} \) singlet at 2.1 must be the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) next to the ketone. We can draw one structure.

We have not previously considered stereochemistry. Hemiacetal (and acetal) formation is thermodynamic control as all the reactions are reversible. The dimer and trimer crystallize from liquid so the stereochemistry may be governed by the formation of the most stable point compound or by the fact that the crystallization of the least soluble diastereoisomer removes the equilibrium and so more is formed. We can see some reasons why the diastereoisomer might be the most stable. The \( c \) is ring junction between the two five-membered rings is much more stable than the trans, the two acetyl groups may prefer to be trans to each other, and there may be a \( \mathrm{H} \) bond in the crystal. We cannot be sure of these reasons but they are explored more in Cha.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

Predicting products of acylation reactions. This is always more difficult than just ... Assume mechanisms but here you can work backwards from the final product as well as forward

## Suggested solution

---

The true product of the acylation is the anion of the phenol: this helps the reaction since \( \mathrm{{KOH}} \) is more basic than ArOH (Chapter 8).

---

The starting material is \( {\mathrm{C}}_{8}{\mathrm{H}}_{8}{\mathrm{O}}_{2} \) so \( \mathrm{A} \) has an extra \( {\mathrm{C}}_{7}{\mathrm{H}}_{4}\mathrm{O} \) . This looks like the addition and the loss of \( \mathrm{{HCl}} \) . The most obvious reaction is acylation at the phenolic oxygen enolate formation as \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) is more acidic than \( \mathrm{{CH}} \) . This is a very acidic phenol as the carbon helps to stabilize the oxyanion. Compound A is simply the benzoate ester of the phenol with \( \mathrm{{KOH}} \) isomerizes \( \mathrm{A} \) to \( \mathrm{B} \) and this is the heart of the problem. An intramolecular acylar-only possible enolate can be catalysed by \( \mathrm{{KOH}} \) even though it produces only a little cyclization to a six-membered ring is so easy.

The final step is acid-catalysed and clearly involves the attack of the phenolic \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) or ketones.

## \( \rightarrow \) -ose of the problem

- erious thinking about the details of acylation reactions. Organic Chemistry Solutions Manual

## Suggested solution

The strong base is necessary in the cyclization because no stable enolate can be formed from the product. In other acylations of esters by esters the product has at least one hydrogen atom on carbon atom between the two carbonyl groups and forms a stable enolate under the reaction conditions. There are several examples in the chapter and the answer to Problem 3 makes a special point of this. The strong base is needed to convert one of the esters completely into its enolate

The stereochemical point is that one of the esters becomes an enolate and so loses stereochemistry but the other must be pointing inwards for cyclization to occur. This can happen reversible formation of the enolate anion.

## Suggested solution

The first part is what you should expect.

The reaction is a charge-controlled combination of nucleophile and a hard electrophile.

In the first step there is chemoselectivity in that the enolate is formed at the centre of the \( \star \) - ester and not on the aldehyde. You may not at first think that the aldehyde can form an enoid. think again.

1 The cyclopentadienone \( B \) is anti-aromatic (four delocalized electrons) and is probably not formed. The first conjugate addition probably starts before the dehydration of the second aldol reaction.

We do not, of course, mean that all these reactions happen at once and there is in fact a good margin) why they do not happen exactly in the order given. The final stage is a normal you lysis and decarboxylation. The stereochemistry simply comes from the preference for two five- - ered rings to be cis-fused (Chapter 33).

## Suggested solution

The IR suggests a dicarbonyl compound and the \( {}^{13}\mathrm{C} \) NMR suggests one aldehyde or ketone (200) and one acid derivative (178). The proton NMR confirms an aldehyde (10.1) and suggests that acid derivative is a methyl ester (3H singlet at \( {\delta 4.3} \) ). Both NMRs show that there is no double be any more. The proton NMR reveals a \( {\mathrm{{CMe}}}_{2} \) group on saturated carbon with no adjacent hydrog. ( \( 6\mathrm{H} \) singlet at \( {\delta 1.21} \) ). There are two \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) groups coupled to each other but to nothing else (the - triplets). All this adds up to this aldehyde-ester.

sow what the disconnection is, because we have been given one starting material, so this looks an enolate alkylation. We must use a specific enolate to prevent the ketone from self-sing. The only problem is that we must use a well-behaved specific enolate - in particular that is nonbasic - so that there is no danger of elimination.

## Suggested solution

The three diketones have 1,3-,1,4-, and 1,5-dicarbonyl relationships. In each case the ob disconnection is the bond joining the ring to the chain. For the 1,3-diketone, this means acylate a ketone.

There are many ways to make the other isomers ( \( Z,Z \) -; E.E-; \( Z,E \) -dienes) and you might have used alternative styles of Wittig reactions or reduction of alkynes (pp. 815-19) or other methods described in Chapter 31.

## Purpose of the problem

A simple stereocontrolled alkene synthesis but both isomers are wanted.

## Suggested solution

There are many methods that can be used to tackle this question. The only snags are protecting the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group if necessary and care in releasing the \( Z \) -compound as it will isomerize easily to the \( E \) - compound by reversible conjugate addition. Here is one way to the \( Z \) -alkene using reduction of an alkyne to control the stereochemistry. The \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group is protected as a benzyl ether removable by hydrogenation, perhaps under the same conditions as the reduction of the alkyne.

The \( E \) -alkyne might be produced by reduction of the alkyne with alkali metal in ammonia but a Wittig reaction is probably easier. Either an vlid or a phosphonate could be used. Protection of the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) as an acetate allows hydrolysis of both esters in the same step.

## Suggested solution

The starting material is \( \mathrm{C} - {\mathrm{H}}_{10}{\mathrm{\;N}}_{2} \) so it has lost nitrogen \( \left( {\mathrm{N}}_{2}\right) \) and gained \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{3}\mathrm{O} \) - one molecule of methanol. We can see the MeO group at 3.5 and the four \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) groups in the ring are still there \( {18}\mathrm{H}\mathrm{m} \) at 1.3-2.7). All that is left is a multiplet at 4.2,obviously next to \( \mathrm{{MeO}} \) ,and a pair of alkene signals at 5.5 and 5.8,coupled with \( J = {17.9}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) - obviously an \( E \) -alkene. One end of the alkene (5.5) is coupled to one proton, the other (5.8) to 2 . We now have these fragments.

These add up to \( {\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{3} \) too much! Clearly,the \( \mathrm{{CH}} \) attached to \( \mathrm{{OMe}} \) and the \( \mathrm{{CH}} \) attached to the alkene must be the same and the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) at the other end of the alkene must be one end of the chain of four.

This is the test of your belief - the dotted ends must be joined up to give the structure of A. Yes, this does put an \( E \) -alkene in a seven-membered ring,and it is difficult to draw,but you were warned that the compound is unstable. The \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) group next to the CHOMe group is diastereotopic and so the coupling constants are different.

## Purpose of the problem

<!-- Media -->

The most obvious way is a halogenation in acid solution (Chapter 21) on the more substituted side of the ketone and elimination of HX in base. The double bond will prefer to go inside the ring and there is no argument about its stereochemistry. Typical bases would be tertiary amines or hindered alkoxides (e.g. \( t \) -BuO).

<!-- Media -->

The mechanism for this last step must involve conjugate addition of the nitromethane anion and conversion of the nitro group to an aldehyde. The stereochemistry is set during the conjugate addition when protonation of the enolate from the less hindered side creates the anti relationship. Notice that the nitromethane anion is regenerated in this step.

## Suggested solution

There are many possibilities. A Wittig approach is particularly attractive as the required aldehyde is vanillin, the common flavouring.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

Practice in analysing a mechanism where stereochemistry gives a clue.

## Suggested solution

The reaction is highly stereoselective but the minor products suggest that a simple dropping out of \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2} \) from the lactone is not the answer. An E1 reaction with a zwitterionic intermediate formed by opening the lactone gives a way to all the products. The clue is that,at the moment \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2} \) is lost,the bond linking it to the rest of the molecule must be parallel to the empty p orbital of the cation.

If loss of \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2} \) is faster than rotation about the central bond,the \( Z \) -acid is formed.

This work showed how easy it was to make strained alkenes by the Wittig reaction (W. G. Dauben and J. Ipaktschi, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1973, 95, 5088).

The isomerization of \( Z \) - to \( E \) -alkene than the dehydration of the alcohol because the protonation of the \( Z \) -alkene is even slower the deprotonation of the cation.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

To show that double bond geometry can affect the stereochemistry of tetrahedral centres stereospecific reactions.

## Suggested solution

First, we must draw mechanisms for the reactions. The first reaction clearly starts by bromination the \( Z \) -alkene to form a bromonium ion (Chapter 20) that is attacked by the amine. The amine choose which end it attacks (and it prefers to form two five-membered rings rather than even one strained four-membered ring) but it has no choice about stereochemistry. We must have \( {tr} \) : addition to the alkene.

The second reaction starts with \( c \) is dihydroxylation by \( {\mathrm{{OsO}}}_{4} \) . This is rather like epoxidation and discussed in full in Chapter 35 (pp. 936-7). The starting material cannot form a lactone as the CE group is held away from the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) group by the \( E \) -alkene. Once the molecule is dihydroxylz-there is no longer any barrier to lactone formation and a five-membered ring is again preferred the alternatives.

## Purpose of the problem

A gentle introduction to the determination of stereochemistry with two dimensions only.

## Suggested solution

The IR suggests a conjugated carbonyl compound, confirmed by the two alkene and one carbonyl signals in the carbon NMR with the additional information that it is an aldehyde or ketone \( \left( {\delta }_{\mathrm{C}}\right. \) about 200). The proton NMR shows that this is a ketone (no CHO proton) and that the alkene has two protons (5.99 and 6.71) and that they are trans (J 16). We also see an ethyl group (2H q and \( 3\mathrm{H} \) t) attached to something with no \( \mathrm{{Hs}} \) (looks like the carbonyl group). This suggests the unit in the margin,which leaves only \( {\mathrm{C}}_{4}{\mathrm{H}}_{8} \) . We know we have \( {\mathrm{{Me}}}_{2}\mathrm{{CH}} \) - from the \( 6\mathrm{H}\mathrm{d} \) and that leaves only \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) . We have a structure.

B is more difficult. The alkene has obviously gone (no signals beyond 4.48) and there is one extra H. It looks as though HBr has added. The coupling of \( {17.7}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) cannot be a trans-alkene as there isn’t any kind of alkene so it must be geminal \( \left( {{}^{2}J}\right) \) coupling. This means the molecule is chiral so that a \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) group is diastereotopic. In fact,the expected conjugate addition of HBr (Chapter 23) has occurred.

We don’t mind which is \( {\mathrm{H}}^{2} \) or \( {\mathrm{H}}^{3} \) as they don’t affect the stereochemistry,but we do mind which - A. K. Mallams and group, J.

Since \( {\mathrm{H}}^{6} \) is a \( {10}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) doublet with \( {\mathrm{H}}^{5} \) ,we know that \( {\mathrm{H}}^{5} \) is at 2.87 and is axial. This gives Chem.

Two diastereoisomers of this cyclic keto-lactam have been prepared. The NMR spectra have many overlapping signals but the proton marked in green in the textbook and here ringed can clearly be seen. In isomer A it is \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{4.12}\left( {1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{q},{J3.5}}\right) \) and isomer B has \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{3.30}(1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{{dt}},{J4} \) , 11, 11). Which isomer has which stereochemistry?

## Purpose of the problem

Assignment of three-dimensional stereochemistry from NMR when only one signal can be made :: clearly.

## suggested solution

The two isomers have cis and trans ring junctions so we should first make conformational drawings. The trans compound is easy as it has a fixed conformation like a trans-decalin (p. 463). The cis compound can have two conformations as both rings can flip.

By NMR, of course. Both compounds are six-membered rings so we should first must conformational drawings of all the possibilities. The first compound can have the \( t \) -butyl - methyl groups cis or trans and the \( t \) -butyl group will go equatorial. The second compound can fix both methyl groups on the same side as the \( t \) -butyl group,both on the other side,or one on each side.

In the second compound a difficulty emerges: there is no coupling!

However, if we irradiate the Sgnal for the methyl groups we should get a strong NOE effect (p. 844) at \( {\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{a}} \) in the all-cis compound and nothing in the trans compound.

## Purpose of the problem

Assigning a more complex NMR and making deductions about stereochemistry in small rings.

## Suggested solution

In cyclopropanes the \( c \) is coupling is usually larger than the trans coupling because the dihedral angle for \( c \) is \( \mathrm{{Hs}} \) is \( {0}^{ \circ  } \) but that of trans \( \mathrm{{Hs}} \) is not \( {180}^{ \circ  } \) . Assigning the three ring hydrogens depends on (a) the quartet coupling to the methyl group and (b) the \( {13}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) coupling to the proton on the alkene. This means that the third ( \( 6\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) triplet) must be next to the carbonyl group. The two trans couplings round the ring are the same(6Hz)and smaller than the \( c \) is coupling(7Hz). The geometry of the double bond is on more certain grounds ( \( {20}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) can only be a trans coupling).

## Purpose of the problem

## Suggested solution

A saturated six-membered ring means conformational drawings again. The proton next to \( \mathrm{O} \) must be the ddq because it is next to the methyl group and the one at 4.3 must therefore be the proto-next to \( \mathrm{{Br}} \) . Both have one large coupling (12 or \( {11}\mathrm{\;{Hz}} \) ) and this must be axial-axial so both protons must be axial.

## Problem 8

The structure of a Wittig product intended as a prostaglandin model was established by the usual methods - except for the geometry of the double bond. Irradiation of a signal at 3.54 (2H,t,J7.5)led to an enhancement of another signal at \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{5.72}\left( {1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{t},{J7.1}}\right) \) but not to a signal at \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{3.93}\left( {2\mathrm{H},\mathrm{d},\mathrm{J}{7.1}}\right) \) . What is the stereochemistry of the alkene? How is the product formed?

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

Exploration of the usefulness of the NOE when coupling constants are of little use.

## Suggested solution

The signal at 5.72 is obviously the proton on the alkene. The \( 2\mathrm{H} \) triplet must be next to the \( \mathrm{N} \) atom and the \( 2\mathrm{H} \) doublet must be between the alkene and the ketone. The NOE falls off as the sixt-power of the distance so the first(E-)alkene is correct. The second(Z-)alkene would give the opposite result. The NOE also suggests that the predominant conformation of the top chain must be as shown with the chain bent away from the alkene.

Finding out how to determine stereochemistry when there is a quaternary chiral centre. group, J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1, 1979, 2629.

## Suggested solution

Irradiation of the MeO signal (2.07) should give an NOE and reveal which of \( {\mathrm{H}}^{1} \) and \( {\mathrm{H}}^{2} \) is on the same side of the ring and may show that \( {\mathrm{H}}^{3} \) is also on the same side. Irradiation of \( {\mathrm{H}}^{1} \) and \( {\mathrm{H}}^{2} \) in turn (you were given the NMR shifts of this part of the molecule so you could see that, fortunately, \( {\mathrm{H}}^{1},{\mathrm{H}}^{2} \) ,and \( {\mathrm{H}}^{3} \) are well separated in the NMR spectrum) should give definite information on the relative stereochemistry. The original work shows clearly that the compound is one diastereoisomer but which one was not determined.

A chemical reaction produces two diastereoisomers of the product. Isomer A has \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{3.08} \) (1H,dt,J4,9,9)and \( {4.32}\left( {1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{d},\mathrm{J}9}\right) \) while isomer \( \mathrm{B} \) has \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{4.27}\left( {1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{d},\mathrm{J}4}\right) \) .

## Suggested solution

There are two diastereoisomers and the difference in coupling constants is striking. These are not true cyclohexanes but partly flattened by the benzene ring and best drawn as cyclohexenes (p. 469). You should imagine the benzene ring coming towards you where the double bond is drawn.

<!-- Media -->

The two protons we can see in isomer A must be \( {\mathrm{H}}^{1} \) and \( {\mathrm{H}}^{2} \) as they have the largest shifts. proton with only one coupling must be \( {\mathrm{H}}^{1} \) as it has only one neighbour \( \left( {\mathrm{H}}^{2}\right) \) . Isomer \( \mathrm{A} \) has a \( \varsubsetneq   - \) coupling between \( {\mathrm{H}}^{1} \) and \( {\mathrm{H}}^{2} \) so both these protons must be axial. Isomer \( \mathrm{A} \) is therefore the ratio isomer. The signal for \( {\mathrm{H}}^{2} \) is a dt because it has two axial neighbours \( \left( {\mathrm{H}}^{1}\right. \) and \( \left. {\mathrm{H}}^{3}\right) \) and one equator neighbour \( \left( {\mathrm{H}}^{4}\right) \) . Isomer B shows \( {\mathrm{H}}^{1} \) only and it is clearly equatorial \( \left( {{J}_{12} = 4}\right) \) . Though we can’t \( {\mathrm{H}}^{2} \) it must be axial as \( \mathrm{B} \) must be the cis-isomer since it is different from \( \mathrm{A} \) . Problem 11

Coupling constants around five-membered rings tend to be much the same whether they are (geminal), \( {}^{3}{J}_{cis} \) ,or \( {}^{3}{J}_{\text{trans }} \) (vicinal). Even so,the two diastereotopic \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) groups are easy to find \( \mathrm{w} \) in their large \( {}^{2}J \) couplings of 13 and 12.5 . The one with one extra coupling must be in the side chai-and the others in the ring. Here is the full analysis. You will see that it is, in fact, very difficult to get conclusive evidence on stereochemistry though you should see that, in general, cis couplings tend : be larger than trans.

## Problem 12

An antifeedant compound that deters insects from eating food crops has the gross structure shown below. Some of the NMR signals that can clearly be made out are also given. Since NMR coupling constants are clearly useless in assigning the stereochemistry, how would you set about it?

\( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{2.22}\left( {1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{d},{J4}}\right) ,{2.99}\left( {1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{{dd}},{J4},{2.4}}\right) ,{4.36}\left( {1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{d},{J12.3}}\right) ,{4.70}\left( {1\mathrm{H},\mathrm{{dd}},{J4.7},{11.7}}\right) . \) 4.88 (1H, d, J 12.3)

## Purpose of the problem

assigning stereochemistry when there are isolated spin systems.

## Suggested solution

The signals given are all of protons next to electronegative atoms. There are two AB systems for the destereotopic \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) groups in the epoxide and the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\mathrm{{OAc}} \) group. The \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\mathrm{{OAc}} \) group is ’normal’ with \( {}^{2}{J12.3} \) and a large shift ( \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{4.36} \) and 4.88). The epoxide is unusual with a much smaller \( {}^{2}J \) of Jy 4 Hz (actually normal for epoxides) and smaller shifts ( \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) 2.22 and 2.99). Both appear isolated the optimic optihe epoxide protons shows long-range coupling to some other proton. These are no help with the stereochemistry but the proton next to the other OAc group \( \left( {{\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{4.70}}\right) \) is clearly axial with -pical axial/axial (11.7) and axial/equatorial (4.7) couplings.

The answer came from NOE experiments There were large NOEs between the \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{4.70} \) axial proton and one of the epoxide protons and between the axial methyl group and one of the protons in the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\mathrm{{OAc}} \) group. The stereochemistry is like this.

## Problem 13

The seeds of the Costa Rican plant Ateleia herbert smithii are avoided by all seed eaters (except a weevil that adapts them for its defence) because they contain two toxic amino acids (IR spectra like other amino acids). Neither compound is chiral. What is the structure of these compounds? They can easily be separated because one (A) is soluble in aqueous base but the other (B) is not.

\( \mathrm{A} \) is \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{9}{\mathrm{{NO}}}_{4} \) (mass spectrum) and has \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{C}}{34.0}\left( \mathrm{d}\right) ,{40.0}\left( \mathrm{t}\right) ,{56.2}\left( \mathrm{s}\right) ,{184.8}\left( \mathrm{s}\right) \) ,and 186.0 (s). Its proton NMR has three exchanging protons on nitrogen and one on oxygen and two complex signals at \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{2.68}\left( {4\mathrm{H},{\mathrm{A}}_{2}{\mathrm{\;B}}_{2}}\right. \) part of \( {\mathrm{A}}_{2}{\mathrm{\;B}}_{2}\mathrm{X} \) system) and 3.37 ( \( \mathrm{X} \) part of \( {\mathrm{A}}_{2}{\mathrm{\;B}}_{2}\mathrm{X} \) system) with \( {J}_{\mathrm{{AB}}}{9.5},{J}_{\mathrm{{AX}}}{9.1} \) ,and \( {J}_{\mathrm{{BX}}} \) small.

B is \( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\mathrm{H}}_{9}{\mathrm{{NO}}}_{2} \) (mass spectrum) and has \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{C}}{38.0}\left( \mathrm{d}\right) ,{41.3}\left( \mathrm{t}\right) ,{50.4}\left( \mathrm{t}\right) ,{75.2}\left( \mathrm{s}\right) \) ,and 173.0 (s). Its proton NMR spectrum contains two exchanging protons on nitrogen and \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{1.17}(2\mathrm{H} \) , ddd, J 2.3, 6.2, 9.5), 2.31 (2H, broad m), 2.90 (1H, broad t, J 3.2), and 3.40 (2H, broad s).

Because the coupling pattern did not show up clearly as many of the coupling constants are small,decoupling experiments were used. Irradiation at \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{3.4} \) simplifies the \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}}{2.3} \) signal to(2H,ddd,J5.8,3.2,2.3),sharpens each line of the ddd at 1.17,and sharpens the triplet at 2.9 .

Irradiation at 2.9 sharpens the signals at 1.17 and 2.9 and makes the signal at 2.31 into a broad doublet, \( J \) about 6 . Irradiation at 2.31 sharpens the signal at 3.4 slightly and reduces the signals at 2.9 and 1.17 to broad singlets. Irradiation at 1.17 sharpens the signal at 3.4 slightly so that it is a broad doublet, \( J \) about 1.0,sharpens the signal at 2.9 to a triplet,and sharpens up the signal at 2.31 but irradiation here had the least effect.

This is quite a difficult problem but the compounds are so small \( \left( {\mathrm{C}}_{6}\right. \) only),have no methyl groups, and have some symmetry so you should try drawing structures at an early stage.

## Purpose of the problem

A difficult problem for those of you who like to try the real thing.

The reaction with ammonia probably starts with the primary alkyl mesylate and the second step is then intramolecular. It is also stereospecific - the \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) displacement must occur with inversion and, fortunately, the amine is already on the bottom face.

The second step is now rather important. Ethoxide will form the enolate of the ester reversible and turn it to the outside, the convex face, of the molecule. Though nitrogen is not normally a fixed chiral centre because it undergoes rapid pyramidal inversion, here it is fixed by the need of the five five fused ring system to have a cis ring junction. The last step is just the reduction of the ester with no change in the stereochemistry.

To show how ring-closing reactions, particularly those on the side of an already existing ring, can give excellent stereochemical control. And again - the importance of conformation in six-membered rings.

We'd better draw the mechanism first, as the question says. Grignard reagents tend to do direct addition to enones and the product shows that the methyl group has done just that. But the resulting \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) is in the wrong position to cyclize to the ester and there doesn’t seem to be much scope for stereochemical control so we probably get a mixture of diastereoisomers.

As all the alcohols are in equilibrium via the allyl cation, only the cis lactone will be formed regardless of the stereochemistry of the tertiary alcohol. Another and probably better explanation is that the ester or the acid derived from it by hydrolysis adds to the allyl cation.

The molecule is folded around the ring junction with one of the ester groups inside the fold (on the concave face) and the other out in the open on the convex face. Since the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2} \) Et group gets larger the rate-determining step in ester hydrolysis - attack of hydroxide ion on the carbonyl group - : outside \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Et}} \) group will be hydrolysed faster. step',

## Purpose of the problem

Another cyclization reaction and an example of a controlled inversion of configuration.

## Suggested solution

The first stereoselective reaction is surprising as it may appear that the initial alkylation decides stereochemistry. But that is not the case as you will see if you draw the mechanism. The estimation enolate is very easily formed as it is stabilized by the pyridine ring and the nitrile as well as by the ester. Even a weakish base like carbonate is good enough.

Proble

The first intermediate produced by alkylation with the primary alkyl bromide (or the epoxide) has two chiral centres and will no doubt be formed as a mixture of diastereoisomers. But this doesn't matter as the enolate has to be reformed for the next alkylation and that destroys one of the chiral centres. We are back to a single compound again.

<!-- Media -->

All depends on the arrangement of the molecule for the cyclization step. The mechanism is straightforward enough but drawing the transition state is tricky. We offer two drawings: an attempt at a conformational drawing and a Newman projection. The vital feature in both is that the enolate carbon,and the \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{O} \) bond of the epoxide must be collinear. The molecule folds so that the end of the five-membered ring bends upwards away from the large pyridine ring. You may have a better drawing. This is not obvious even when you know the answer.

## Purpose of the problem

A reminder that cyclic molecules may stop some reactions as well as helping to control others.

## Suggested solution

Formation of the lithium enolate leads to elimination in the first example. If we rotate the central bond of the starting material we see that this would be a cis elimination so it must be E1cB and not E2. The stereochemistry of the product is determined stereoselectively by the best arrangement in the transition state for the elimination step.

In the elimination step the \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{O} \) bond joining the benzoate leaving group to the rest of the molecule must be parallel to the p orbitals of the lithium enolate. There is no problem about this.

## Purpose of the problem

Though ultimately it disappears, explaining the stereoselectivity of the reduction is interesting and applicable elsewhere.

## Suggested solution

This looks complicated but it's just a question of working through each reaction. The stereochemistry needs some thought. The first reaction is a conjugate addition of a sulfur nucleophile to a very electrophilic alkene. The base used, piperidine, is an ordinary secondary amine but that is basic enough \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}}}\right. \) about 11) to produce reasonable amounts of anion from the thiol \( \left( {\mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}}}\right. \) also about 10). There is no stereochemistry in this step.

The next stage is an intramolecular Claisen ester condensation. We can easily discover which enolate reacts with which ester by drawing the starting material in the shape of the product. The alternatives are three- or six-membered rings: five-membered rings are more stable than three- and more rapidly formed than six-membered. Under the reaction conditions there is no stereochemistry as the product exists as a stable conjugated enolate ion (p. 724).

The reduction is the stereoselective step and the hydrogen atom is added from the face of the ketone opposite the larger substituent. The oxyanion so formed reacts with the ester to give a five-membered lactone. The other ester group equilibrates via the stable enol or enolate until the ketone is reduced. Then it is fixed in whatever configuration it happens to be.

## Purpose of the problem

NMR revision. In determining stereochemistry, as in other parts of chemistry, the evidence does matter.

## Suggested solution

The structure of \( \mathrm{B} \) is obviously symmetrical and the two \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) groups must be \( c \) is (both in or both: out). We should expect A to be reduced to the trans compound as the nucleophile would attack from the convex face of the folded molecule. This suggests that \( \mathrm{B} \) is the cis (inside) diol and \( \mathrm{A} \) has its one \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group inside too.

The NMR spectrum of A has two large couplings (7.5 and 9.0) between the marked Hs. These look more like cis than trans couplings (cis couplings are larger than trans couplings in four-membered rings). The signal at 4.46 must be the proton next to \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) and the other two must have

additional couplings to protons \( {\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{X}} \) and \( {\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{Y}} \) . All this data fits if protonation of the silyl enol ether - Details in B. M.

## Purpose of the problem

The aldol is a versatile and important way of controlling open-chain stereochemistry by way cyclic transition state.

## Suggested solution

The geometry of the enolate is all important (p. 898) and here the large \( t \) -butyl group will give the \( Z \) -lithium enolate. Then the mechanism has a saturated six-membered cyclic (Zimmerm. Traxler) transition state with the R group of the aldehyde RCHO taking up an equatorial position This gives the syn aldol.

Notice that in the transition state: (1) R chooses to go equatorial; (2) the methyl group is force axial because it is \( c \) is to OLi; (3) the \( t \) -butyl group forces the aldehyde to add to the back face of enolate as drawn.

## Purpose of the problem

An example of the important iodolactonization reaction.

## Suggested solution

The bicarbonate \( \left( {\mathrm{{NaHCO}}}_{3}\right) \) is a strong enough base to produce the anion of the carboxylic acid. Iodine attacks the alkene reversibly to give a mixture of diastereoisomers of the iodonium ion. If the \( {\mathrm{I}}^{ + } \) and Me groups are on the same side of the chain,the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}^{ - } \) group can attack the iodonium ion from the back and set up a trans iodolactone. The iodolactone is cleaved by methoxide and the oxyanion displaces iodide to give the epoxide.

## Purpose of the problem

Practice at the Felkin-Anh style of stereochemical control.

## Suggested solution

In each case we have nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group with a neighbouring chiral centre. The Felkin analysis tells us first to put the largest group perpendicular to the carbonyl group and then to bring the nucleophile in alongside the smallest substituent. This is best shown with a Newman projection (p. 888). In the first case it is better to rotate the front atom so that the two Ph groups are at \( {180}^{ \circ  } \) and we can draw the structures in the same way.

We have chosen azide ion \( \left( {\mathrm{N}}_{3}^{ - }\right) \) as the nucleophile. Ammonia will also do as,although it can react repeatedly, it usually behaves itself with epoxides. You were not asked to make both diastereoisomers, so we can stop there. Problem 11 Explain the formation of essentially one stereoisomer in this reaction.

We have inevitably drawn the syn aldol product as one enantiomer but so far there is no control over absolute stereochemistry.

There is an important lesson to be learnt here. The principles we have been explaining are generally true but in any individual case the result may not follow the principle. This is particular. true of Felkin control with aldehydes as \( \mathrm{H} \) and \( \mathrm{O} \) are not that different in size. You should first apply the principle (here Felkin control) and then check the result. You should not be ashamed if you go? this one wrong.

The first reaction clearly involves the formation of an enolate from the only enolizable compound the anhydride) and its attack on the aromatic aldehyde. The cyclization that follows may look a bit ... ward but it forms a five-membered ring and the leaving group is a stable carboxylate anion. There is no stereochemical control in this step.

If a more reactive alkene (electron-donating \( \mathrm{O} \) makes the HOMO energy higher) is provided,the ketene adds to that instead.

The regiochemistry arises because the alkene is an enol ether and the large coefficient in its HOMO interacts with the central atom of the ketene, that is, the largest coefficient in the LUMO.

The stereochemistry at the remaining centre comes from the way in which the two molecules approach each other. The two components are orthogonal and the dotted lines in the middle diagram below show how the new bonds are formed. The carbonyl group of the ketene will prefer to be in the middle of the ring and the side chain on the ketene will bend down away from the top ring. These \( \left\lbrack  {2 + 2}\right\rbrack \) thermal cycloadditions normally give the all-cis product.

## Suggested solution

The diene is electron-rich and will use its HOMO in the cycloaddition. It will therefore prefer the alkene with the lowest LUMO and that must be the unsaturated ester. Both substituents on the diene direct reaction to the same end. We can predict this from electron donation from the ox-atoms.

We are making two new rings. The six-membered ring containing a cis-alkene presents no problem. The eight-membered ring with a ketone in it might present a problem, and the ten-membered ring with the trans-alkene is definitely a problem. It is much easier to make medium (8- to 14-membered) rings when there is a cis-alkene elsewhere in the ring and the benzene ring helps there. It increases the population of conformations with the ends of their chains close together. It probably also lowers the energy of the LUMO.

## Purpose of the problem

Investigating the stereoselectivity of the intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction.

## Suggested solution

Intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions can give endo or exo products. We should first discover which this is. Drawing the transition state for the endo product, we find that the endo product is indeed formed. So electronic factors dominate, perhaps because the dienophile has such a low-energy LUMO and has two carbonyl groups for secondary orbital overlap with the back of the diene. Problem 5 Explain the formation of single adducts in these reactions.

The regiochemistry is not quite so simple. The diene has the larger HOMO coefficient at the to-end, as drawn, so we must deduce that the largest LUMO coefficient in the unsymmetrical quinons is at the top left as drawn. This is probably because conjugation with the MeO group makes the to-carbonyl and the right-hand alkene less electrophilic and the bottom carbonyl activates the top enc of the left-hand alkene. If you prefer, it is an 'ortho' product.

The second example is intramolecular so the regioselectivity is determined by that alone - the ester linkage between the diene and the dienophile is too short for them to join up the other way round. This same link ('tether') also forces the dienophile to approach the diene from the botto: face. All that remains is the endo/exo question and the diagram shows that the answer is endo with the carbonyl group tucked under the back of the diene.

The regioselectivity comes from the contribution of the EtO group to the HOMO of the diene and the dominating influence of the conjugated \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Me}} \) group on the LUMO of the dienophile. Neither the other \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2} \) Me group nor the sulfur atom is conjugated to the alkene of the dienophile and neither has much influence on the reaction.

J. Tutarello and R. G. Gatrone, Tetrahedron Lett.. and away from the phenyl group. There is no stereoselectivity as there is no conjugating group and 1978, 2753. - no exo/endo selection.

Reduction with zinc cleaves the \( \mathrm{N} - \mathrm{O} \) bond and \( {\mathrm{{MnO}}}_{2} \) oxidizes the allylic alcohol to the enone. At this point there is only one chiral centre so the mixture of diastereoisomers has become one compound. Conjugate addition of the amine gives the new ring.

The stereochemistry is more difficult to explain. The product has a trans ring junction from choice but has the Ph group axial - obviously not from choice. This must be the kinetic product. It looks as though the ring must close with the best overlap between the nitrogen lone pair and the orbital of the enone to give a cis ring junction, which equilibrates by pyramidal inversion at nitroge to the more stable trans ring junction.

## Purpose of the problem

Selectivity and application of forward and reverse Diels-Alder cycloadditions.

## Suggested solution

The reaction is clearly a cycloaddition but at first sight the regioselectivity is all wrong. The answer comes from a realization that this is a reverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction. The diene very electron-deficient with two conjugated carbonyl groups so the dienophile needs to be electron-rich. The enone is not electron-rich enough but its enol is. The enone could be prepared by Birch reduction

The stereochemistry of the reduction is easy to explain as the molecule is folded in such a way that only the bottom face of the carbonyl group is open to nucleophilic attack. The oxyanion croduced can immediately cyclize to form the lactone. Clearly,this is possible only if the \( {\mathrm{O}}^{ - } \) group \( \Rightarrow \) up,but it is also possible only if the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2} \) Me groups are on this side of the molecule.

But we can't use diagrams like that for mechanisms! The cycloaddition uses maleic anhydride as a two-electron component with a low LUMO. We could use one of the dienes in the ring to provide four electrons but their ends are far apart and the electron-deficient ring is a poor HOMO. If we include the sulfur atom we can provide eight electrons and an atom (S) with a large HOMO coefficient. The tricyclic product is clearly folded back on itself so that the triene in the seven-membered ring and the carbonyl groups in the anhydride are close.

If the starting material were heated it would no doubt undergo a Diels-Alder reaction but the dier-and dienophile are poorly matched.

How is the unwanted product formed? Addition of a small amount of a weak base,such as \( {\mathrm{{PhNMe}}}_{2} \) , helps prevent the unwanted reaction. How?

## Purpose of the problem

Electrocyclic and cycloaddition reactions again with some stereochemical interest.

## Suggested solution

The cyclobutene opens in a four-electron conrotatory electrocyclic reaction. The cyanide can go either way and it will prefer to go out. The diene so produced is unstable and is extremely reactive in cycloadditions as it regenerates the benzene ring that way. The regiochemistry is predictably 'ortho' and we should probably use the HOMO of the diene and the LUMO of the unsaturated ester.

The stereochemistry shows that a 1:1 mixture of exo and endo products is formed.

An unusual electrocyclic reaction on an anion with stereochemistry and NMR revision.

The first anion \( \mathrm{A} \) is formed by removal of the only possible protons - those on the one \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) groin the molecule. This anion might be considered aromatic (six electrons from the three dout bonds, two from the nitrogen, and two from the anion) but it is clearly unstable as it closes in 2 electrocyclic reaction at \( >  - {35}^{ \circ  }\mathrm{C} \) .

I This example comes from a general investigation into the Beckmann and the related Schmidt rearrangements by R. H. Prager et al., Aust. J. Chem., 1978, 31, 1989.

## Suggested solution

The first reaction forms the oxime by the usual mechanism (Chapter 14). This reaction is thermodynamic control so the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group will bend away from the aryl substituent. Then we buy the Beckmann rearrangement (pp. 997-9). The group anti to the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group migrates from \( \mathrm{C} \) : and that gives the product after rehydration and adjustment of protons.

## Purpose of the problem

Rearrangements involving boron and a ring-closing rearrangement of sorts plus stereochemistry.

## Suggested solution

The starting material is symmetrical so it doesn't matter which face of which alkene you attack. The only important thing is that the boron binds to the more nucleophilic end of the alkene and that \( {R}_{2}B \) and \( H \) are added cis. Alkaline \( {\mathrm{H}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{2} \) makes the hydroperoxide anion (HO-O \( {}^{ - } \) ) and that attacks boron. The important migration follows: the whole ring moves from boron to oxygen with retention of configuration. Hydrolysis and mesylation (p. 484) give the first intermediate.

## Purpose of the problem

Rearrangements as proof of structure? Surely not! Wait and see.

## Suggested solution

The expected three-membered lactone would have a very high carbonyl stretching frequency because of ring strain (pp. 365-6).

## Purpose of the problem

An unusual group migrates and stereochemistry gives a clue to mechanism.

## Suggested solution

The mechanism for the reaction must involve Lewis acid complexation of the epoxide oxygen atom,cation formation,and migration of \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Et}} \) . This last point may surprise you but inspection of the structure of the product shows that the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Et}} \) group is indeed bonded to the other carbon atom.

<!-- Media -->

Although something like this must happen, our mechanism raises as many questions as it answers.

- Why does that bond of the epoxide open? Answer. Because the tertiary benzylic cation is much more stable than a secondary cation next to a \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Et}} \) group.

- Why does the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Et}} \) group migrate rather than the \( \mathrm{H} \) atom? Answer. For the same reason! If the \( \mathrm{H} \) atom migrates,the product would be a cation (or at least a partial positive charge would appear in the transition state) next to the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Et}} \) group.

- Surely the carbocation intermediate is planar and the product would be racemic? Answer. This - This mechanism was investigated was the purpose of the investigation. One chiral centre is lost in the reaction so only absolute by R. D. Bach and co-workers; J. Am. stereochemistry is relevant. One explanation is that the cation is short-lived and that bond ro Chem. Soc., 1976, 98, 1975; 1978, 100, 1605. tation is fast in the direction shown (the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2} \) Et group is already down and has to rotate through only \( {30}^{ \circ  } \) to get in the right position for migration). The other is that the migration is concerted. This looks unlikely as the orbital alignments are poor.

There are a few minor traps here that we're sure you avoided. The first compound has two carbons groups, but esters don't do Baeyer-Villiger rearrangements so only the ketone reacts. The more substituted carbon atom migrates with retention of configuration (pp. 992-7). The aldehyde rearranges with migration of the benzene ring in preference to the hydrogen atom. The last compound is \( {C}_{2} \) symmetric so it doesn’t matter which group migrates as long as you ensure retention of configuration (and take care when re-drawing as the migrating group is drawn the other way up).

## Purpose of the problem

Exploring the 'semipinacol' rearrangement with some revision of stereochemistry and acetal formation.

## Suggested solution

The formation of the acetal is by the usual mechanism (p. 342) with one twist. The double bond is in conjugation with the ketone in the starting material but has moved in the acetal. There is no longer any conjugation possible but how and why does it move? How is easy. At several stages in the acetal mechanism, intermediates are formed that can enolize - we show one possibility. The conjugated and the unconjugated intermediate are in equilibrium and either can cyclize to the acetal. So the 'unconjugated' acetal must be more stable. This is partly because one of the C-Q bonds must be axial and it is better for the acetal centre to be on a true chair than on a twist-chair conformation.

The rearrangement starts with chemoselective tosylation of the secondary alcohol. Base then initiates the rearrangement itself by removing the proton from the tertiary alcohol. The stereochemistry follows the usual path - the migrating group goes with retention and the tosylate carbon is inverted. In an ordinary pinacol rearrangement either of the alcohols could be protonated but in this 'semi-pinacol' rearrangement only the secondary alcohol is tosylated and so it must leave. The migrating group is selected by whichever bond is anti-periplanar to the C-OTs bond. In this case it is the ring junction bond as the OTs group is equatorial (see diagram in the margin).

## Purpose of the problem

To show that ring expansion from three- to four-membered rings and ring contraction the other way are about as easy.

## Suggested solution

The first mechanism is a pinacol rearrangement and the compound is symmetrical so it doesn't matter which alcohol is protonated. Both three- and four-membered rings are strained and the \( \sigma \) -bonds are more reactive (higher HOMO energy) than normal. This makes ring contraction an easy reaction even though the strain is not relieved.

To show that heteroatoms can migrate too given the chance and revision of Chapters 14 and 21 Suggested solution

The first step is a standard acid-catalysed halogenation of a ketone via the enol (p. 533) and the second looks at first like a standard imine formation (p. 349) until you notice that the Br has been replaced by \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) . Imine formation starts in the usual way but,before the carbonyl oxygen leaves,it is ideally placed to displace the bromine and form an epoxide. Opening the epoxide with the nitrogen atom completes the migration of oxygen from one atom to another.

## Purpose of the problem

Helping you to recognize the Favorskii reaction (p. 990).

## suggested solution

The most acidic proton in the molecule is the \( \mathrm{{NH}} \) of the amide. Loss of the chloride ion from the Stilling anion gives a sort of oxyallyl cation and this can close in a disrotatory electrocyclic two-accretion process. The resulting cation is just a strange way of drawing a three-membered cyclic and attack of hydroxide on this strained molecule releases the best anion (nitrogen) and gives the product. We know that the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) group in the product is down and so the conrotation must scar with the hydrogen (and the lone pair on nitrogen) rotating up. This puts the new three-the rethered ring on the outside (exo- or convex face) of the folded ring system.

Removal of the hydroxyl proton by the base promotes a fragmentation that is really a reverse aldol reaction. It works because the bond being fragmented is in a four-membered ring.

Fragmentations linked to ester hydrolysis (contrast acetal hydrolysis in Problem 3) plus stereochemistry.

The ester can be hydrolysed with \( \mathrm{{KOH}} \) and the four-membered ring disappears in the fragmentation. As usual, draw the mechanisms first and worst about the stereochemistry later.

But what about stereochemistry? We are not told the stereochemistry of the starting materials. but we do know that the \( 5/4 \) fused rings must have \( c \) is ring junctions. This junction survives in the first compound so the stereochemistry looks wrong. The second compound gives us the clue. The mentation product is an enolate at the ring junction. When it tautomerizes to the ketone it will the more stable trans \( 8/5 \) ring junction. In the same way,the enolate from the first sequence is - equilibrium under the reaction conditions with all the other enolates of the same diketone scruding those at the ring junction. This is a stereoselective reaction.

whering is the best idea. There is no change necessary in the carbon skeleton other than the Regmentation of the \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{C} \) bond at the ring junction.

The \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{C} \) bond to be broken is not strained so a good reason for the fragmentation must be and. The base \( \mathrm{{KH}} \) is easily strong enough to remove the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) proton entirely and sulfone is a good _____an-stabilizing group.

That gives us the carbon skeleton of the product. Now the sulfone-stabilized carbanion can Howe a proton from either position next to the ketone to make an enolate. The Hs between the and the double bond are the more acidic. Replacing this proton on the end of the double puts the methyl group in place. Finally, we repeat this process, removing a second hydrogen to make an extended enolate and eliminating the sulfone group as a sulfinate anion \( \left( {\mathrm{{PhSO}}}_{2}^{ - }\right) \) in E1cB process. These proton transfers need not be intramolecular.

## Purpose of the problem

Probably the most beautiful application of fragmentation yet by a true genius of chemistry, As a 1 Eschenmoser, Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl., 1979, 18, 634, 636.

## Suggested solution

The tosylate is obviously the leaving group, the two oxygen atoms in the rings must become the ester group,and the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}^{ - } \) must leave as \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2} \) . All that remains is to trace an electron pathway from \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}^{ - } \) to \( \mathrm{{OTs}} \) via one of the ring oxygens using parallel bonds. Though you : draw a mechanism for this double fragmentation in one step, it is not convincing. The constraints electrons antiparallel to the C-OTs bond are those in the ring junction bond and the equator lone pair on one of the ring oxygens.

## Purpose of the problem

A rather simpler exercise in fragmentation also used to form a medium-sized (11-membered) ring.

## Suggested solution

The strong base removes the proton from the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group and the oxyanion attacks one of the carbonyl groups (they are the same). This intermediate can decompose by the loss of the oxygen that has just come in but it can alternatively lose the enolate of the other ketone. The product is then an ester with its extra conjugation and protonation of the enolate completes the reaction. The eleven-membered ring is more stable than usual because of the benzene ring (compare the solution to Problem 3, Chapter 35) and because the ester oxygen does not suffer from interactions across the ring.

- As Hendrickson says; 'The reaction forms five asymmetric centres but its stereospecificity may be predicted from the presumption that the sequence of mechanistic steps includes no irreversible reactions. Hence the thermodynamically most stable product should result.'

The last two diagrams show where the stereochemistry comes from. The final product has a constraint of six-membered ring. The 1,3-bridge on the bottom must be 1,3-diaxial so it is better to have inevitable axial bond to the five-membered ring on the opposite, top, face. The pyrrolidin: equatorial. In other words, this is the most stable diastereoisomer of the product and that mean reversible reactions and thermodynamic control. Finally, the fragmentation itself. Methylation the amine provides the leaving group and addition of hydroxide to the ketone provides electronic push. Notice that the \( \mathrm{C} - {\mathrm{N}}^{ + } \) bond,the \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{C} \) bond being fragmented,and a lone pair the \( {\mathrm{O}}^{ - } \) group are all parallel. Notice also that the hydrogen atoms on the cis-alkene in the pro-are already cis in the intermediate. The cis ring junction too is already there.

The second reaction is base-catalysed and starts with the hydrolysis of the ester by NaOH This fragmentation also needs 'push', though only a three-membered ring is being brok-because the leaving group is an enolate, nowhere near as electron-withdrawing as the wave molecule or even the carbocation of the first example. Are they fragmentations? In both case \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{C} \) bond is broken but we would understand if you felt the first was not strictly fragmentation, especially if it goes stepwise. Neither breaks the molecule into three pieces it's all a matter of opinion.

The Eschenmoser fragmentation uses a tosyl hydrazone of an \( \alpha ,\beta \) -epoxy-ketone (p. 1008). epoxide can be made with alkaline hydrogen peroxide and the tosylhydrazone needs tosylhydrazine to form what is simply an imine. Then the fun can begin. The stereochem: doesn't matter for once.

## Purpose of the problem

A subtle effect of stereochemistry and reagent combined on two fragmentation pathways for the same compound.

## Suggested solution

Sodium borohydride is a weak reducing agent and fragmentation (push by \( \mathrm{N} \) and pull by \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{O} \) ) is faster. The borohydride reduces the iminium salt to a methyl group and, at the other end of the molecule, the product is the 'keto' form of a phenol.

The second reaction starts with the rapid reduction of the ketone by the more powerful reducing agent \( {\mathrm{{LiAlH}}}_{4} \) . Hydride is added from the less hindered face of the ketone opposite the phenyl group. Then, on treatment with acid, the alcohol does fragment but by a different pathway. The amine can no longer participate as it is protonated under the reaction conditions. It may look awkward to do the fragmentation with two separate cations as intermediates but both are stable and the stereochemistry is all wrong for anything concerted.

Revision of rearrangements from Chapter 37 with a new fragmentation.

## Suggested solution

The ring opening and the rearrangement cannot be all concerted because the group on the 'wrong' side of the molecule migrates. There must be a cationic intermediate. In contrast, attack of bromide occurs stereospecifically from the side opposite to the migrating group so this is presumably concerted with the migration.

The only way to produce the observed product is to decompose the diazonium salt homol. To do this we must draw the 'salt' as a covalent compound or transfer one electron from the chloride ion to the diazonium ion. The other product would be a chlorine radical. Addition alkene gives the more stable radical, which abstracts chlorine from the diazocompound and : the chain going.

Further treatment with \( {10}\% \) aqueous \( \mathrm{{NaOH}} \) gives one easily separable product in modest yield (50%). What are the mechanisms for the reactions? What might the minor products be?

## Suggested solution

The most likely initiation at \( {500}^{ \circ  }\mathrm{C} \) is the cleavage of the \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{{Cl}} \) bond to release allyl and chloride radicals. The chloride radicals then attack the alkene and abstract a proton to give an allylic radical.

Occasionally in the mass spectrum (gas phase, he-vacuum) you get the very rare loss of \( {\mathrm{H}}^{ \bullet  } \) ,a reaction that never occurs in solution.

## Purpose of the problem

Working out the consequence of an important substituent effect on radical reactions: the cyclopropyl group.

## Suggested solution

The peroxide is a source of \( t \) -BuO* radicals and these abstract a hydrogen atom from the methyl group of the hydrocarbon. The first spectrum is that of the cyclopropylmethyl radical. The odd electron is in a p orbital represented by the circle and the plane of the \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}^{ \bullet  } \) group is orthogonal to the plane of the ring but the two \( {\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{a}} \) s are the same because of rapid rotation. The odd electron has a large coupling to the two hydrogens \( \left( {\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{a}}\right) \) on the same carbon,a smaller doublet coupling to \( {\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{b}} \) ,and small couplings to the two \( {\mathrm{H}}^{ \circ  }\mathrm{s} \) and two \( {\mathrm{H}}^{ \circ  }\mathrm{s} \) . The coupling to \( {\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{b}} \) is small because the \( \mathrm{p} \) orbital containing the odd electron is orthogonal to the \( \mathrm{C} - {\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{b}} \) bond.

Warming to \( - {90}^{ \circ  }\mathrm{C} \) causes decomposition to an open-chain radical. The odd electron is coupled to the two hydrogens on its own carbon \( \left( {\mathrm{H}}^{a}\right) \) and those on the next carbon \( \left( {\mathrm{H}}^{b}\right) \) ,each giving a triplet (22.2 and 28.5). Coupling to the more remote hydrogen atoms is small.

Decomposition of the same hydrocarbon with \( t \) -BuOCl produces the same sequence of radicals but now they can be intercepted by the chlorine atom of the reagent releasing more \( t - {\mathrm{{BuO}}}^{ \bullet  } \) radicals and a radical chain started.

## Purpose of the problem

Application of radical reactions in an important sequence plus revision of conformation an-stereochemistry.

## Suggested solution

The first step involves deprotonation of the rather acidic amide (the \( {\mathrm{{CF}}}_{3} \) group helps) and the displacement of the only possible bromide - the one on the opposite face of the six-membered rim; as the \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) must take place with inversion.

The only tricky thing is to make success you complete the chain and don’t use \( {\mathrm{H}}^{ \bullet  } \) at any point.

Finally, we need to hydrolyse the amide. This normally requires strong acid or alkali but the trifluoroacetyl group is significantly more electrophilic than most acyl groups and milder conditions

can be used. In this final step of his epibatidine synthesis, E. J. Corey actually used sodium - E. J. Corey and group, J.

## Suggested solution

The starting material is an obvious Diels-Alder product as it is a cyclohexene with a carbonyl group outside the ring on the opposite side. The first step is iodolactonization. Iodine attacks the alkene reversibly on both sides but ,when it attacks opposite the carboxylate anion, the lactone ring snaps shut.

The question asks for a conformational drawing of the product and indeed that is necessary. The 3 lactone bridge must be diaxial as that is the only way to reach across and the carboxylate group must attack the iodonium ion from an axial position too. You can regard this as the formation of the trans diaxial product as in the opening of a cyclohexene oxide with a nucleophile (pp. 468-70).

The last step is initiated by AIBN, which removes an iodine atom from the compound to make a scondary radical. This attacks the allyl stannane and the intermediate loses \( {\mathrm{{Bu}}}_{3}{\mathrm{{Sn}}}^{ \bullet  } \) and that takes over the job of removing iodine atoms to keep the chain going. The radical intermediate has no stereochemistry at the planar radical carbon. Attack occurs on the bottom face to avoid the 1,3- ciaxial bridge.

## Purpose of the problem

Rehearsal of a useful method to make radicals and further exploration of stereochemistry.

## Suggested solution

Borohydride reduces the mercury to unstable \( - \mathrm{{HgH}} \) . This decomposes to provide an alkyl radical for conjugate addition to acrylonitrile. Though the starting material has stereochemistry, the alkyl radical is flat and, in an open-chain compound, has no reason to react one side rather than the other. Compare with the previous problem.

## Problem 13

Reaction of this carboxylic acid \( \left( {{\mathrm{C}}_{5}{\mathrm{H}}_{8}{\mathrm{O}}_{2}}\right) \) with bromine in the presence of dibenzoyl peroxide gives an unstable compound \( \mathrm{A}\left( {{\mathrm{C}}_{5}{\mathrm{H}}_{6}{\mathrm{{Br}}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{2}}\right) \) that gives a stable compound \( \mathrm{B} \) \( \left( {{\mathrm{C}}_{5}{\mathrm{H}}_{5}{\mathrm{{BrO}}}_{2}}\right) \) on treatment with base. The stable compound has IR 1735 and \( {1645}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{-1} \) and NMR \( {\delta }_{\mathrm{H}} \) (p.p.m.) 6.18 (1H,s),5.00 (2H,s),and 4.18 (2H,s).

## Purpose of the problem

Revision of structural analysis in combination with an important radical functionalization.

## Suggested solution

The starting material is \( {\mathrm{C}}_{5}{\mathrm{H}}_{8}{\mathrm{O}}_{2} \) so the stable compound \( \mathrm{B} \) has gained a bromine and lost three hydrogens. There must be an extra double bond equivalent (DBE) in B. The IR spectrum shows that the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) has gone and suggests a carbonyl compound,possibly an ester because of the high frequency, and an alkene. The NMR shows that both methyl groups have gone and been replaced by

Since both methyl groups are functionalized,the unstable \( \mathrm{A} \) must have one \( \mathrm{{Br}} \) on each methyl group. The peroxide produces benzoate radicals that abstract a proton from allylic positions to give stabilized radicals and these attack bromine molecules providing bromine atoms to continue the chain reaction. In base,the carboxylate ion cyclizes on to the \( {cis}{\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Br}} \) group.

## Purpose of the problem

Another important carbene method used in the synthesis of a natural antibiotic.

## Suggested solution

The diazo-compound decomposes to gaseous nitrogen and a carbene under catalysis by Cu(II). Insertion into the exposed alkene gives the three-membered ring. The stereochemistry comes partly from the 'tether' - the linkage between the carbene and the rest of the molecule that delivers the carbene to the bottom face of the alkene. The rest comes from the inevitable cis fusion between the six- and three-membered rings.

The twisted alkene of a trans-cycloheptene is unstable and rotates to the much more stable alkene even at \( {20}^{ \circ  } \) .

Metathesis is usually \( E \) -selective and these are both \( E \) -alkenes so prospects are good.

The product is racemic because the two intermediates have planes of symmetry and are achiral. The retention of relative stereochemistry (formation of trans product from trans starting material) could result from stereoselective recombination (the two faces of the allylic cation are not the same) or from the two ions sticking together as an ion pair so that the acetate anion slides across the cation on the same face. It cannot be explained by a \( \left\lbrack  {3,3}\right\rbrack \) -sigmatropic rearrangement (Chapter 36) as this would not randomize the label in the same way.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

The Hammett relationship gives an intimate picture of the Beckmann rearrangement.

## Suggested solution

The normal mechanism for the Beckmann rearrangement involves protonation at \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) and migration of the group anti to the \( \mathrm{N} - \mathrm{O} \) bond (pp. 997-9),in this case the substituted benzene ring

<!-- Media -->

If this mechanism is correct, we should expect the migration itself to be the slow step. The fit-step is just a proton transfer to oxygen and must be fast. The steps after the migration involve attach of water on a carbocation and proton transfers between \( \mathrm{O} \) and \( \mathrm{N} \) . These must all be fast. The migration forms and breaks a C-C bond and creates an unstable cation. But does this agree with evidence? Starting material and product in the migration step are cations so the transition state mir-be a cation too. Any contribution to cation stability made by the migrating group will be welcome we should expect electron-donating groups to migrate faster. This is what we see: a \( \rho \) value of-1 shows a modest acceleration by electron-donating groups (pp. 1093-8).

In the Beckmann rearrangement, the anti group migrates, but in other rearrangements migrating group is chosen for a very different reason: it is normally the group best able to stabilize positive charge and benzene rings can do this by \( \pi \) participation (pp. 973-5). This would be a participation mechanism.

---

The Hammett \( \rho \) value of -2.0 gives very definite evidence that \( \pi \) participa tion does not occur. If It did, the closure of the unstable three-membered ring would undoubtedly be the slow step and a positive charge would be formed inside the benzene ring itself. This would give a much larger \( \rho \) Blue of something like -5.0 or more. One reason participation does not occur is that the starting material is planar and the \( \mathrm{p} \) orbitals in the benzene ring cannot point in the right direction to interact with the \( {\sigma }^{ * } \) orbital of the \( \mathrm{N} - \mathrm{O} \) bond. They are orthogonal to it.

Also. the \( {\mathrm{{CF}}}_{3} \) group is very electron-withdrawing so nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group will be unusually fast. This is why there is a region of pH-independent hydrolysis not found with EtOAc (p. 1104). You could have suggested that acetate was a nucleophilic or a general base catalyst but the solvent deuterium isotope effect suggests that it is a general base.

## Purpose of the problem

Interpretation of a small Hammett \( \rho \) value.

## Suggested solution

The most obvious explanation for a small Hammett \( \rho \) value,that the aromatic ring is too far aw. from the reaction site, will not wash here as the aromatic rings are joined directly to the reaction nitrogen atoms of the carbodiimide. The reaction must surely start with the protonation of one these nitrogen atoms. This cannot be the slow step and it would in any case have a large negative \( \rho \) value. The small observed \( \rho \) value suggests that the rate-determining step must have a positive \( \rho \) value that nearly cancels out the large negative \( \rho \) value for the first step. Attack by water on the protonated carbodiimide looks right.

<!-- Media -->

The expected equilibrium Hammett \( \rho \) value for the protonation would be about -2.5 to -3 so the kinetic Hammett \( \rho \) value for the attack of water would have to be about +2 to give a net Hammett value of -0.8 . This looks fine. The rest of the mechanism involves proton transfers, hydrolysis of imide, and decarboxylation.

Since \( {S}_{N}1 \) produces a carbocation delocalized around the benzene ring in the slow step,a large negative Hammett \( \rho \) value is reasonable. It is not obvious what sign the Hammett \( \rho \) value would have in the \( {S}_{N}2 \) mechanism as there is no build-up of charge near the benzene ring in the transition state so a small value is reasonable. The actual value -0.3 is very small indeed but, if we can read anything into it at all, it does suggest a slightly loose transition state with a very small (δ (ε)?) charge on the carbon atom.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

An extreme example of surprising catalysis.

## Suggested solution

At first you might ask how chloride can catalyse anything at all. It is a weak base and not a very good nucleophile for the carbonyl group. However, in polar aprotic solvents like acetonitrile (MeCN), chloride is not solvated and is both more basic and more nucleophilic. In this reaction it cannot be a nucleophilic catalyst as attack on the carbonyl group simply regenerates the starting material. It cannot be a specific base as it is too weak, even in MeCN, to deprotonate methanol. But it can act as a general base. Notice how we have arrived at general species catalysis as a last resort after eliminating the other possibilities.

## Purpose of the problem

Deducing a mechanism from isotope effects and entropy of activation.

## Suggested solution

The inverse solvent deuterium isotope effect indicates specific acid catalysis (pp. 1102-4) and the modest negative entropy of activation suggests some bimolecular involvement. There are various mechanisms you might propose but the right one must surely involve cleavage of the three-membered ring in the protonated amine. The second or possibly the third step could be rate-determining.

Once the three-membered ring is opened, the rest of the reaction amounts to acid-catalyse hemiacetal hydrolysis. The alcohol is a hydroxylamine and the carbonyl compound benzaldehyde. An alternative mechanism, favoured by the original authors (J. H. Fendler an group, J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 2, 1973, 1744), starts with protonation of the oxygen atom and ends up with the hydrolysis of an imine. Again, the second or the third step could be rate-determining.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

Making sure you understand the ideas behind the Hammett relationship.

## Suggested solution

The obvious thing to do is to plot the \( \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{{aH}}} \) values of the substituted pyridines against the \( \sigma \) values for the substituents using meta values for the 3-substituted and para values for the 4-substituted compounds (table on p. 1092). This gives quite a good straight line and we get a slope (Hammett \( \rho \) value) of +5.9. The sign is, of course, positive as the same electronic effects that make benzoic acids more acidic will also make pyridinium ions more acidic. The large \( \rho \) value may have surprised you, but reflect. Ionization of benzoic acids occurs outside the ring and the change isn't delocalized round the ring. Deprotonation of pyridinium ions occurs on the ring and the charge (positive this time) is delocalized round the ring. gan atoms 1 be rate-

## Purpose of the problem

Extension of a section of the chapter (p. 1111) into new reactions with internal trapping of intermediates.

## Suggested solution

- reaction (a) the bromination must occur on the alkene to give a dibromide. We cannot suggest tereochemistry at this stage and it is better to continue with the standard Favorskii mechanism and ... what happens. Everything is the same until the very last step when the opening of the Exclopropane provide electrons in just the right place to displace the second bromide and put the couble bond back where it was. This alternative behaviour of a proposed intermediate gives us confidence that the intermediate really is involved.

The stereochemistry of the initial bromination turns out to be irrelevant as it disappears when the oxyallyl cation is formed. We know the stereochemistry of the final product so we know the stereochemistry of the cyclopropanone: it must be on the opposite face of the five-membered ring to the methyl group. The disrotatory closure of the oxyallyl cation goes preferentially one way with the \( \mathrm{H} \) and \( {\mathrm{{CMe}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Br}} \) substituents going upwards and the carbonyl group going down.

You may wonder how the presence of excess \( {\mathrm{{MeO}}}^{ - } \) stops this from happening. It doesn’t. The oxyallyl cation and the cyclopropanone are in equilibrium and excess \( {\mathrm{{MeO}}}^{ - } \) captures cyclopropanone and drives the normal Favorskii reaction onwards.

## Purpose of the problem

Following up two interesting and unusual reactions from p. 1080.

## Suggested solution

We put these reactions into the chapter just to remind you that there are lots of reactions you haven't met yet. They were chosen deliberately to have less than obvious mechanisms so, if you get reasonable answers, you should be pleased. The first is an example of the oxidation of an enolate an 'oxaziridine' - one of a family introduced by F. A. Davis and B. C. Chen, Chem. Rev., 1992, 92. 919. The weak N-O bond breaks under attack by the enolate and the sulfonyl group makes the nitrogen atom a good leaving group. The electrophilic oxygen atom adds to the top face as that is the outside (exo or convex face) of a folded bicyclic system (pp. 865-70).

The problem is that the thermal \( \left\lbrack  {2 + 2}\right\rbrack \) cycloaddition is not allowed and the electrocyclic ring sening would have to be conrotatory and that would put a trans double bond in the eight-membered ring.

\[{K}_{1} = \frac{\left\lbrack  \text{ cuolate }\right\rbrack  }{\left\lbrack  \mathrm{{Pl}}\right\rbrack   \cdot  {\mathrm{{COCH}}}_{2}\mathrm{C}\left\lbrack  {\mathrm{{ClO}}}^{ - }\right\rbrack  }\]

And so the rate expression becomes (substituting for unknown [enolate])

\[\text{rate} = {k}_{2}{K}_{1}\left\lbrack  {{\mathrm{{PhCOCH}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Cl}}}\right\rbrack  \left\lbrack  {\mathrm{{EtO}}}^{ - }\right\rbrack  \left\lbrack  \mathrm{{ArCHO}}\right\rbrack  \]

and this matches the given rate expression though the apparently third-order rate constant revealed as an equilibrium constant \( \left( {K}_{1}\right) \) multiplied by a second-order rate constant \( \left( {k}_{2}\right) \) .

The Hammett \( \rho \) value shows a modest gain of electrons in the transition state. We must not : the pre-equilibrium into account in this as \( \mathrm{{ArCHO}} \) is not involved in that step. In fact a Hamr- \( \rho \) value of +2.5 is typical of nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group conjugated with the aroma-ring (see p. 1095 for an example).

The unexpected products come from variations in this mechanism. para-Methoxy-benzaldeh: is conjugated and unreactive so that the chloroketone ignores it and does a Darzens reaction itself, rather like the self-condensations we met in Chapter 21.

<!-- Media -->

There are many types of evidence you could have considered including those below. There are many others.

- Exchange of protons in \( {\mathrm{D}}_{2}\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{{EtOD}} \) is necessary for the elimination/addition mechanism.

- Kinetic evidence (tricky as you cannot be sure what is the rate-determining step).

- A Hammett plot with substituted benzene rings. Again the result depends on which step is slow in mechanism 2,but the simple \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) reaction would give a very small \( \rho \) value as the benzene ring is a long way from the scene of action.

- Base catalysis. Mechanism 2 is base-catalysed; mechanism 1 is not.

- Kinetic isotope effects might be found in mechanism 2.

- Stereochemistry. If a substituent were added to make the terminal carbon chiral, inversion would

be expected for mechanism 1 but racemization for mechanism 2 as the enone is achiral. Problem 16

(iii) The Hammett \( \rho \) value is -4.5 .

What conclusions can you draw about the dehydration?

Recalling that the dehydration goes faster than the isomerization, what would be present in the reaction mixture if the result isomerization were stopped at 50% completion?

## Purpose of the problem

Interpretation of data for three closely related reactions where results from each support the other

## Suggested solution

Our first impressions of the \( E/Z \) isomerization are that it is a simple reaction. Protonation obvi-occurs at \( \mathrm{C}2 \) in the rate-determining step and a cation delocalized round the benzene ring mid-formed in the step too. The slow step is proton transfer to carbon. There is more than deuteration at \( \mathrm{C}2 \) because,although only one deuterium atom is added,the last step will lead

rather than \( \mathrm{D} \) because of the kinetic isotope effect. A ratio of 4:1 is reasonable.

The dehydration reaction shows a normal kinetic deuterium isotope effect indicating loss

## Purpose of the problem

Revision of the mechanism of a reaction related to acetal and imine formation (Chapter 14).

## Suggested solution

The nitrogen atom is more nucleophilic than the oxygen atom so we should start with the amine attacking the carbonyl group. The first product will be an imine and addition of the alcohol to that gives the product. Imine formation is acid-catalysed but occurs quite rapidly at neutral \( \mathrm{{pHs}} \) and the intramolecular second step is fast. The whole system is under equilibrium but the other product, water, is driven off as an azeotrope with benzene so the equilibrium is driven over to give the heterocyclic product in 77-94% yield according to A.

As you now know (p. 1134) all esters and lactones prefer to be in the conformation shown for the first compound so that they can enjoy stabilization by the anomeric effect. The second ester would also prefer to be like this too (first diagram below) but in this conformation it cannot cyclize at all. Even in the less favourable conformation it uses for reaction, it prefers conjugate to direct substitution as the latter would give a strained trans-cycloheptene. The first compound can enjoy both the anomeric effect and conjugate addition as a trans-alkene in a ten-membered ring is fine. It is better than fine in the heterocyclic product as the lactone also enjoys the anomeric effect. Problem 8

There seems at first sight to be little to choose between A and B: each has two axial and to equatorial substituents. In fact, the NMR shows clearly that the molecule exists as A. The acet prefers the OMe group axial because of the anomeric effect so that in A three groups have the preferred conformation.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

An example of the formation and rearrangement of a four-membered heterocycle.

## Suggested solution

The first reaction is a photochemically allowed \( \left\lbrack  {2 + 2}\right\rbrack \) cycloaddition (pp. 927-9). The alternative product would come from the alkene in the quinone being used instead of the carbonyl group. The regiochemistry is not obvious but the light is absorbed by the quinone and the coefficient in the SOMO must be larger in the carbonyl groups. The stereochemistry simply results from the concerted reaction: those hydrogens were cis in cyclooctene and remain cis in the product.

<!-- Media -->

The second step is the dienone-phenol rearrangement (pp. 988-9). The oxygen atoms in the soduct still have a para relationship so it must be the carbon atom in the ring that migrates. Notice Let the carbon atom migrates with retention of configuration, as expected from other migrations, the cis ring junction is preserved in the product.

But why does carbon migrate rather than oxygen? Oxygen is good at migrating because it can participate (pp. 969-73) and a very reasonable product could be formed.

<!-- Media -->

It is true that the stereoelectronics for both the first and second step are not good but the main - asons are probably that the intermediate is very strained with fused three- and four-membered ages and that oxygen is also very good at staying behind and encouraging other groups to migrate. we should redraw our first mechanism slightly so that the oxygen atom can still use a lone pair.

The decomposition of the dithiolane anion is a reverse cycloaddition and occurs because stabilization given to the anion by two sulfur atoms is not very great. This anion is an enolate as well. so it is much more stable. Conjugate addition is preferred (p. 751) with more stable enolates an-this anion is an enolate additionally stabilized by two sulfur atoms. The three groups (ester and S atoms) combine to make a stable anion good at conjugate additions.

Whether the oxetane or the THF is formed depends on which end of the iodonium ion is Ecked by the OH group. In terms of Baldwin’s rules (pp. 1140-4), oxetane formation is a simple - co-tet reaction and is favoured. THF formation is slightly more complicated. It is 5-exo-tet as far the new ring is concerned but it is 6 -endo-tet as far as the \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) reaction is concerned. In the station state the nucleophile, the carbon atom under attack, and the leaving group are part of the the six-membered ring.

Furans normally prefer substitution at the \( \alpha \) positions (2 and 5) but one \( \alpha \) position is already locked and the other is too far away to reach the allylic cation. Attack at the other end of the allylic tion would give an eight-membered ring with a trans alkene in it. That would theoretically be Possible but closure of six-membered rings is much faster.

## Suggested solution

The reducing agent is the same in both reactions \( \left( {\mathrm{{NaBH}}}_{4}\right) \) : the only difference is the acylation at the pyridine nitrogen atom. The reaction to the right looks straightforward so we'll start with the Acylation at nitrogen gives an electrophilic pyridinium ion that accepts hydride from \( {\mathrm{{BH}}}_{4}^{ - } \) to the product. Steric hindrance is not an issue with this small reagent and the ethyl group \( t \rightarrow  0 \) deactivates the other \( \alpha \) position and stabilizes the diene product.

then if the proposed electrophilic substitution by that notoriously erratic reagent formaldehyde Sechanal, \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\mathrm{O} \) ) gave a clean product,it would not be the one required as furan reacts more - dily in the \( \alpha \) positions so we should get 2-benzyl-4-furanol instead. The route that works starts win the synthesis of a heterocycle known as an oxazole in a strange reaction called the 'Bredereck action'. It probably goes like the scheme below, but the order of events is uncertain. If you reacted the ammonia with the ketone first,or even with the formate to give formamide \( \left( {\mathrm{{HCONH}}}_{2}\right) \) ,you with well be right.

What aromatic system might be based on the skeleton given in the margin? What sort of reactivity might it display?

## Purpose of the problem

thance for you to be creative about aromatic compounds.

## Suggested solution

The aromatic system has the poetic name 'pyrrocoline' and you will have found it by trial and error. One ring looks like a pyridine and one like a pyrrole but counting the electrons should have made you realize that we need the lone pair of the nitrogen atom to get a 10-electron aromatic system eight from the four double bonds and two from the nitrogen) so it is a pyrrole-like nitrogen. We can therefore expect it to be good at electrophilic substitution on the five-membered ring and that is exactly what it does. The easiest pyrrocolines to make happen to have alkyl groups at position 3 and these compounds are nitrated to give mainly the 4-nitro compound. Acylation under Friedel-Crafts conditions gives the same isomer.

The first reaction is the nitration of imidazole in one of only two free positions. The position next only one nitrogen is more reactive than the one between the two nitrogens.

The nitration occurs only because this pyridine is activated by the extra amino group so you could have started by predicting which compound might be made. Alternatively, you could work out the structure from the spectrum. The key points are that \( \mathrm{A} \) has only three aromatic protons so nitration has occurred on the ring,that there is only one coupling constant large enough to be ortho(8Hz),and there is a proton that has only meta coupling(2Hz)at large shift. The pyridine nitrogen causes large thifts at positions 2,4 , and 6, the nitro group causes large ortho shifts, and the amino group causes spfield ortho shifts to smaller \( \delta \) . All this fits the structure and mechanism shown. This isomer is formed because the amino group directs ortho, para and the para position is preferred sterically.

## Purpose of the problem

Your first chance to devise syntheses for five-membered aromatic heterocycles with one or two heteroatoms.

## Suggested solution

These compounds all look much the same, but the strategies needed for each are rather different. Removing the heteroatom from the thiophene reveals a 1,4-diketone to be made by one of the methods in Chapter 30 (pp. 800-1). We have chosen to use an enamine and an \( \alpha \) -bromoketone though there are many other good choices.

The second compound is a thiazole and we want to use a thioamide to make it (pp. 1199-200). We should disconnect \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{N} \) and \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{S} \) bonds to give the thioamide and another \( \alpha \) -bromoketone, remembering to let the nucleophiles exercise their natural preferences: sulfur displaces the halide and nitrogen attacks the carbonyl group.

An oxygen heterocycle and the question of selectivity in its synthesis.

The left-hand ring is obviously aromatic as it is a benzene ring. The right-hand ring has electrons from the double bonds and can have a lone pair from the oxygen in the ring, making six all. Alternatively,the whole system can be considered as a \( {4n} + 2 \) system with 10 electrons. Ei: way, it is aromatic. This is more obvious in a delocalized form.

## Suggested solution

The analysis in the chapter (p. 1200 reproduced below) shows that we need the thioamide of cenzoic acid (thiobenzamide available from Aldrich) and an \( \alpha \) -bromoketone. We need these particular starting materials because the soft sulfur atom will displace the bromide in a frontier-orbital-controlled \( {\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{N}}2 \) reaction whilst the hard amino group will attack the ketone in a charge-controlled nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group.

We still need to make the bromoketone and that will come from the bromination of the parent keto-acid. This in turn, being a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound, comes from chemistry discussed in Chapter 30 (pp. 800-1) and in Problem 3 above. A selection of possible disconnections is given here. There is no problem about the bromination as the ketone is more easily enolized than the acid and it can be brominated only on one side. The aromatic deactivated by the carbonyl group.

Saturated and aromatic heterocycles combined with stereochemistry make a neat synthesis.

## Suggested solution

The first starting material is a stable cyclic enamine and conjugate addition is what we should expect with an enone. Of course, if the aldehyde were unprotected, direct addition might occur there as well as carbonyl condensations. The product is in equilibrium with both its enols, one of which can cyclize to form the new six-membered ring. The enol must attack the five-membered ring in a cis fashion as the tether is too short to reach the other side. There is no control over one stereogenic centre but that is unimportant as it is soon to disappear.

- An alternative mechanism is a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the azide on to the enamine.

Now comes the interesting bit. The two reagents A and B combine without losing anything - evident that the enamine must be the nucleophile and so the azide must be the electrophile. We : see from the final product that the enamine attacks one end or the other of the azide. Trial and error takes over!

## Suggested solution

This question is long so a quick answer is best. Addition of two electrons and one proton in a Bi-reduction (pp. 628-9) gives a unique structure with the dianion on oxygen and the two alk conjugated with the OMe groups. Methylation of this enolate gives the first intermediate.

A simple exercise in the creation of a new stereogenic centre via a cyclic intermediate.

## Purpose of the problem

First steps in planning an asymmetric synthesis by resolution.

## Suggested solution

You need to ask: which is the first chiral intermediate? Can it be conveniently resolved? Will the chirality survive subsequent steps? The first intermediate is chiral but it enolizes very readily and the enol is achiral so that's no good. The second compound is definitely chiral but it has three chiral entres and these are evidently not controlled. We should have to separate diastereoisomers before resolution and that would be a waste of time since all the diastereoisomers give the next Intermediate.

<!-- Media -->

The next intermediate, the amino alcohol, is ideal: it has only one chiral centre and that is not affected by the last reaction. It has two 'handles' for resolution - the amine and the alcohol. We might make a salt of the amine with tartaric acid or an ester of the alcohol with some chiral acid. Afternatively, we could resolve tazadolene itself: it still has an amino group so we could again form a salt with a suitable acid.

## Purpose of the problem

Detailed analysis of the synthesis of an important chiral auxiliary by the chiral pool strategy.

## Suggested solution

This is the chiral pool strategy (pp. 1222-5): a cheap, readily available natural product (an amino acid from protein) is built into the product and provides its chirality. It is essential that no racemization occurs while the carbonyl group is still there so a reducing agent effective without strong acid or base is ideal. The cyclization with diethyl carbonate is not so critical as the chiral centre is now more secure but the conditions are again mild.

The second reaction creates a lithium enolate and alkylates it. It is again stereospecific at the unchanged chiral centre but stereoselective at the newly created quaternary centre.

The alkylation is under kinetic control and, as lithium enolate has more or less a flat ring, the July halide comes in on the opposite face to the \( t \) -butyl group.

This is Seebach's elever method of preserving the knowledge of a chiral centre while it is destroyed in a reaction.

## Purpose of the problem

Comparison of two good methods.

## Suggested solution

---

1 The other enantiomer of the alcohol is, of course, the product of the enzymatic reaction and is left behind in solution.

---

The advantages are that the enzymatic resolution is quick and efficient, that the catalyst is needed in only small amounts, and that the reagent is water. The disadvantages are that the yield can never be more than 50%, that the other enantiomer cannot be made, and that the enzyme is likely to be expensive. The ee is not \( {100}\% \) because this is not the natural substrate for the enzyme. It is remarkable that the enzyme does as well as this.

---

1 These methods are compared by W. E. Ladner and G. M. Whitesides, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1984, 106, 7250.

---

Chemically, the obvious way is to use Sharpless epoxidation followed by esterification. The advantages of this method are that it can be used to make either enantiomer, that it is cheap and catalytic,and that an unskilled worker can do it. Only \( t \) -BuOOH is consumed. Problem 9

## Purpose of the problem

Comparison of two more good methods.

## Suggested solution

Baker's yeast is successful only if the compound is a good substrate for the reducing enzymes in the reast. Clearly, the compound on the left is, and that on the right isn't. The BINAP-catalysed hydrogenation doesn't have such specific requirements and works well for both compounds. If it works,the yeast is a good and cheap if rather messy method while the Ru catalyst is expensive but more reliable.

## Purpose of the problem

A combination of conformational analysis, stereoselective reactions, and resolution to get a single enantiomer.

## Suggested solution

The first reaction is a conjugate addition that evidently goes without any worthwe stereoselectivity. The stereochemistry is not fixed in the addition but in the protonation of enolate in the work-up. Equilibration of the mixture by reversible enolate formation gives most the all-equatorial compound.

Reduction by that smallest reagent, electrons, gives the all-equatorial product.

<!-- Media -->

The faces of the ketone are enantiotopic (the carbonyl group lies in a plane of symmetry) so the reduction must give a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers, that is, the alcohol is racemic. Now the faces of the alkene are diastereotopic (there is no longer a plane of symmetry) and the epoxidation takes place stereoselectively on one face because the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group hydrogen bonds to the reagent (p. 897). Asymmetry must be introduced at the first stage to create a single enantiomer of the alcohol. Then the epoxidation will automatically create a single enantiomer of the epoxide.

The second reaction is a simple Wittig process. It stereoselectively gives the cis ( \( Z \) -) alkene as it is a non-stabilized ylid (pp. 814-18). The three-dimensional stereochemistry is entirely controlled by the starting material. If we want a single enantiomer of the product, we must start with a single enantiomer of the aldehyde-ester. Asymmetry must be introduced before this reaction sequence.

## Suggested solution

The more stable enolate, conjugated with the aromatic ring, can be made by a variety of methods and alkylated by various electrophiles with groups suitable for transformation into the required chain. It is easiest to go straight there. Reduction of the ketone gives an alcohol that can eliminate only in the direction we want.

In all three cases the starting materials are already chiral. If the allylic alcohol or the cyclic ammonium salt were prepared, by resolution or by asymmetric synthesis, as a single enantiome: then A too would be a single enantiomer. However, the ketone used in the first route, though also chiral, has an achiral enolate so asymmetry could be introduced at that point. It isn't possible to use the chiral enolates described in the chapter (p. 1230). Probably the easiest approach is to make the allylic alcohol by asymmetric reduction, say by the CBS reducing agent (p. 1234).

The ylid forms in the usual way but can't reach across the ring to attack the carbonyl group direct so it has to do conjugate addition instead. It also has to attack from the top face as it is tetrice there.

recking that you understand the mechanism and stereochemistry of sulfoxide eliminations and \( \because \) sion of Chapter 41.

## Suggested solution

The mechanism given in the chapter (pp. 1269-70) is a reverse cycloaddition of a sulfenic acid and 2. alkene. This can be drawn in two ways (they are really the same) depending on whether you draw 5 - sulfoxide with \( \mathrm{S} = \mathrm{O} \) or as an ylid. This fits the evidence quite well. The substituent on sulfur is involved but that on carbon (R) will accelerate the reaction if it makes the proton that is ": ""oved more acidic. We might expect a positive entropy of activation as two molecules are being - med from one, but pericyclic reactions are notorious for large negative entropies of activation "<cause of the high order of the transition state. A modest negative value seems fair. The sulfoxide is that the products are not so the transition state is presumably slightly less polar than the Tring materials; hence the solvent effect.

Sulfoxide elimination is a cis reaction so the oxygen atom cannot reach the hydrogen at the ring action and has to eliminate into the side chain methyl to give the unstable exo-methylene impound. We know that the elimination into the ring is preferred because the other Estereoisomer, which has a free choice, prefers to do just that.

## Suggested solution

The ylid is stabilized by conjugation of the anion with the ester group - it is also an enolate. We can expect reversible addition to the carbonyl group and hence conjugate addition by thermodynamic control. The stereochemistry of the ring junction is inevitable: only a cis ring junction can be made. The only interesting centre is the ester on the three-membered ring. It too is in the more stable arrangement: on the outside of the folded molecule. The intermediate is probably a mixture of diastereoisomers so either the conjugate addition is reversible and only that diastereoisomer cyclizes that can give the more stable product or, less likely, the product epimerizes by enolization.

base can do nothing to our sulfur compound so it must do something by itself - 291 at sulfur is the answer. Sulfur is a good soft nucleophile and allylic iodides are excellent iles. Now the weak base can remove a proton because the result is an enolate and a ylid as well.

Now what will the cation do? It could capture the external nucleophile, trifluoroacetate, but that s very weak and there is another nucleophile close at hand: the alkene. We know the regioselectivity Som the structure of the product, but it looks as though the alkene prefers to act in an exo manner, probably because of better overlap of the orbitals. The stereochemistry of the side chain comes from 2 transition state already having the side chain on the outside of the molecule as it folds and the lack of control in the SMe group is unimportant as it can be removed with Raney nickel anyway.

## Eurpose of the problem

where and phosphorus combine to make macrolactonization possible.

## suggested solution

there is no problem in getting lactones to form in smaller rings but the difficulty with medium and age rings is to get the carboxyl group and the hydroxyl group close together. You may not have the explanation we give below but you should have been able to deduce the roles of the Subsphine and the disulfide in outline. In a Mitsunobu-style reaction the phosphine attacks the Subjede and prepares a reagent that acylates the thiolate anion. The resulting thiolester can trap a station between the carbonyl oxygen and the nitrogen of the pyridine. This proton could come from the alcohol, and the hydrogen-bonded structure holds the alcohol and the acid close together. because it is attached to the pyridine, the thiolate is a good leaving group and the macrolactone terms. As the alcohol is the nucleophile, there is no change in the stereochemistry.

Sulfur is necessary to provide a good nucleophile, a good leaving group from phosphorus, and a [25] le starting material that reacts in an ionic sense (an \( \mathrm{O} - \mathrm{O} \) analogue would react to form radicals).

Purpose of the problem

Rehearsal of the important mechanism that leads to functionalization of allylic positions with selenium.

## Suggested solution

The first step in both cases is an ene reaction with the \( \mathrm{{Se}} = \mathrm{O} \) bond (pp. 1270-1). The electrophilic selenium attacks the less substituted end (largest HOMO coefficient) of the alkene and a proton is removed from the methyl group trans to the main chain. Then a \( \left\lbrack  {2,3}\right\rbrack \) -sigmatropic rearrangement puts the double bond back where it was (trans selectively) and functionalizes the old methyl group with an oxygen atom.

## Purpose of the problem

Another check on your understanding of the important regio- and stereoselectivity in hydroboration.

## Suggested solution

The most important interaction in hydroboration is between the HOMO of the alkene (here a diene) and the empty orbital (LUMO) on boron (p. 1279). Here the ends of the diene have the larger coefficients. The reaction occurs on the opposite face of the diene to the one occupied by the substituent, especially as it must occur next to that substituent. In the oxidation, the less substituted group migrates with retention.

The closure of the lactone must be done with inversion of configuration at the alcohol centre. W: should normally use a Mitsunobu reaction for this but mesylation is a good alternative. Mesylation occurs via the sulfene with retention and then displacement of this excellent leaving group requires inversion and the cis lactone is formed. Problem 9 Give mechanisms for these reactions, explaining the role of silicon. Why is this type of lactone difficult to make by ordinary acid- or base-catalysed reactions?

- This chemistry played a vital part in a synthesis of steganone by E. R. Larson and R. A. Raphael, Tetrahedron Lett., 1979, 5041.

- The 'silicon-directed Beckmann fragmentation' was discovered by K. Itoh and group, Tetrahedron Lett., 1983, 24, 4021.

The second reaction is a fragmentation and it shows silicon in a useful role of directing a reaction by stabilizing a \( \beta \) -cation. Without the \( {\mathrm{{Me}}}_{3}\mathrm{{Si}} \) group,the oxime would do the Beckm rearrangement. Only with tertiary centres does a fragmentation occur (p. 1003). The \( {\mathrm{{Me}}}_{3}\mathrm{{Si}} \) gr makes the cation as stable as a tertiary cation (at least) and fragmentation occurs. Notice the use \( {\mathrm{{Me}}}_{3}\mathrm{{Si}} - \mathrm{{OTf}} \) as a Lewis acid to set the fragmentation going.

## Purpose of the problem

More basic silicon chemistry: the Peterson reaction again with sulfur around and \( \beta \) -silyl cati doing something new. Revision of the Beckmann fragmentation.

How to make an allyl silane and one important reaction. derival

The reaction with \( {\mathrm{{EtAlCl}}}_{2} \) is a Lewis-acid-catalysed conjugate addition of the allyl silane on to the enone. Conjugate addition is preferred because the nucleophile (allyl silane) is tethered to the electrophile (enone) and the five-membered ring is easier to form than the alternative seven-membered ring.

The stereochemistry comes from the way the molecule prefers to fold. The Newman projection below should be clear. The hydrogen atom on the allyl silane tucks under the six-membered ring and the double bond of the allyl silane projects out into space to give the stereochemistry found in the product. The ratio of this and the other diastereoisomer varies from 2:1 to 7.5:1 depending on the conditions so there isn't all that much in it.

The \( {\mathbf{k}}^{ - } \) point is that the \( {\mathrm{{SiMe}}}_{3} \) group is selectively removed in preference to a proton so the double bond in the product is where the \( {\mathrm{{SiMe}}}_{3} \) group was.

## Purpose of the problem

Making sure you understand the basic Heck reaction.

## Suggested solution

The reaction must start with the oxidative insertion of \( \mathrm{{Pd}}\left( 0\right) \) into the \( \mathrm{{Ph}} - \mathrm{I} \) bond. The reagent added is \( \mathrm{{Pd}}\left( \mathrm{{II}}\right) \) so one of the reduction methods listed in the box on p. 1322 must provide enough \( \mathrm{{Pd}}\left( 0\right) \) to start the reaction going. The oxidative insertion gives PhPdI and this does the Heck reaction on the alkene. Addition occurs from the less hindered top (exo-) face and the phenyl group is transferred to that same face.

## Purpose of the problem

Introducing you to 'aminopalladation' - like oxypalladation - nucleophilic attack on a palladium \( \pi \) -complex.

## Suggested solution

The \( \pi \) -complex of the alkene and \( \mathrm{{Pd}}\left( \mathrm{{II}}\right) \) allows nucleophilic attack by the amide on the nearer end and in a cis fashion because the nucleophile is tethered to the alkene by only two carbon atoms. Nucleophilic attack and elimination of palladium(0) occur in the usual way. The removal of the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Bn}} \) group would normally be by hydrogenolysis but in this case ester hydrolysis by,say,HBr treatment would be preferred to avoid reduction of the alkene. The free acid decarboxylates spontaneously. Problem 4

## Suggested solution

The first reaction is a Lewis-acid-catalysed reaction between the amine and the aldehyde ar. addition of the allyl silane to the resulting iminium salt. Addition occurs at the other end of the allylic system and on the opposite face to the silicon. The most obvious way to put the reagents together looks excellent until we realize,from the Newman projection,that the two \( \mathrm{{Hs}} \) in the product would then be anti whereas they are actually syn.

We can reverse this stereoselectivity by using the other isomer of the iminium salt. Evidently, 'R' is larger than \( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2} \) . Addition now gives a \( \beta \) -silyl cation that loses silicon to give the syn isomer of the product.

Now the coupling can take place on the palladium atom producing the product and \( \operatorname{Pd}\left( 0\right) \) ,which can insert oxidatively in the \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{{Cl}} \) bond.

B is clearly an aldehyde and a ketone with nothing but singlets in the NMR. On the other hand, \( \mathrm{C} \) has a cis-disubstituted alkene with a small \( J \) value and is a cyclopentenone. Here are their structures.

## Purpose of the problem

Looking at organometallic chemistry from the other side: how is it used?

## Suggested solution

The simplest disconnections for the two reactions are remarkably similar. Both make one bond next to the ketone and the bond on the far side of the ring. In addition, the Pauson-Khand reaction requires disconnection on the other side of the ketone as \( \mathrm{{CO}} \) is one of the reagents. The position of the final alkene in the Nazarov product is not determined by the position of the double bond in the starting materials (pp. 962-3).

<!-- Media -->

Our preferred solution for the first compound is a Nazarov reaction as the starting material is symmetrical and it is not necessary to use a vinyl silane, though this would work well too. The starting alkene is easily made from cis-butenediol. The double bond in the product will much prefer to go inside the ring where it is more highly substituted.

The third compound was made by a Pauson-Khand reaction using the same starting material the first. The only difference between these two target molecules is the position of the double bond In the Nazarov reaction, it goes into the thermodynamically most favourable position but in Pauson-Khand reaction it goes where the alkyne was. So we simply react the cyclic ether with acetylene cobalt carbonyl complex. The \( c \) is stereochemistry is inevitable.

## Purpose of the problem

Practice at unravelling the Vollhardt co-trimerization.

## Suggested solution

Starting the Vollhardt reaction in the usual way (p. 1340) we get a cobalt heterocycle that can do : Diels-Alder reaction on to the nitrile of the ester. Loss of cobalt (the cyclopentadiene is omitted from this step for clarity) gives a pyridine.

Now we have a rather unusual Vollhardt co-trimerization. We can start by making the cobalt heterocycle but we cannot then do the Diels-Alder mechanism. Instead the cobalt must combine the reagents to form a seven-membered ring from which it withdraws as it couples its two ligands. The hydrogens in the product are cis because they were cis in the enamine but there is no stereoselectivity in which side of the new ring is occupied by the cobalt. Fortunately, this doesn't matter as both diastereoisomers give the same product after the cobalt is removed.

Revision of Chapter 41. This reaction is subject to general base catalysis. Explain.

## Purpose of the problem

Exploring the similarities of phosphate ester hydrolysis to ordinary ester hydrolysis.

## Suggested solution

The completely uncatalysed reaction involves nucleophilic attack by the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group on the \( \mathrm{P} = \mathrm{O} \) bond to form a five-covalent intermediate much like the tetrahedral intermediate in carboxylate ester hydrolysis. There is a difference. Phosphorus prefers five-membered rings to any other size and the cyclic ester is formed rapidly with loss of ROH. Attack of water on the cyclic ester is also fast: in the complete reaction the phosphate may have migrated from one \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group to the other.

<!-- Media -->

The reaction is subject to general base catalysis because the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group is a poor nucleophile and removal of its proton during the ring closure accelerates the reaction.

## Problem 4

Primary amines are not usually made by displacement reactions on halides with ammonia. Why not? The natural amino acids can be made by this means in quite good yield. Here is an example.

Why does this example work? Comment on the state of the reagents and products under the reaction conditions. What is the product and how does it differ from the natural amino acid?

## Purpose of the problem

Exploration of simple amino acid chemistry.

## Suggested solution

The problem with displacement of alkyl halides with ammonia is not that the reaction doesn't work but that it works too well. The primary amine \( {\mathrm{{RNH}}}_{2} \) is more nucleophilic than ammonia and reaction again and so on until a useless mixture of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines is formed.

## Problem 5

Human hair is a good source of cystine, the disulfide dimer of cysteine. The hair is boiled with aqueous \( \mathrm{{HCl}} \) and \( {\mathrm{{HCO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) for a day,the solution concentrated,and a large amount of sodium acetate added. About 5% of the hair by weight crystallizes out as pure cystine \( {\left\lbrack  \alpha \right\rbrack  }_{\mathrm{D}} - {216} \) . How does the process work? Why is such a high proportion of hair cystine? Why is no cysteine isolated by this process? What is the stereochemistry of cystine? Make a good drawing of cystine to show its symmetry. How would you convert the cystine to cysteine?

No cysteine is isolated because: (1) most of it is present as cystine in the hair; (2) any cysteine released in the hydrolysis will be oxidized to cystine by air. The stereochemistry of cysteine is preserved in cystine,which has \( {C}_{2} \) symmetry and can be best represented by diagrams that show its symmetry - two are suggested. It is not important whether you draw the zwitterion or the neutral structure. Reduction of the \( \mathrm{S} - \mathrm{S} \) bond by,say, \( {\mathrm{{NaBH}}}_{4} \) is needed to convert cystine into cysteine. Problem 6

## Purpose of the problem

Following the details of a simple dipeptide formation.

## Suggested solution

The glycine ester needs to be prepared as its salt to prevent the free amino group forming an amide with the ester. Protection of the amino group of proline as its Cbz derivative (p. 653) is a standa: method and relies on the greater reactivity of the amino group (greater than that of the carboxylate anion) towards carbonyl substitution reactions. The chloroformate gives a mixed anhydride that reacts cleanly with glycine ethyl ester in the presence of \( {\mathrm{{Et}}}_{3}\mathrm{\;N} \) to give the protected dipeptide. Nucleophilic attack occurs at the more electrophilic acyl group rather than at the more delocalized carbonate group

## Suggested solution

The full structure of glutathione (p. 1356) is a tripeptide but the reactive group is a thiol (SH) on a cysteine in the middle. We shall represent glutathione as GSH. The first compound reacts by nucleophilic aromatic substitution (pp. 590-5) aided by the nitro groups. After the reaction, the dangerously electrophilic dinitrochlorobenzene cannot react with enzymes or DNA but is carried away attached to a short water-soluble peptide.

## Purpose of the problem

Rehearsal of some basic amino acid and enzyme chemistry plus revision of stereochemistry (Chapter 16) and asymmetric synthesis (Chapter 45).

## Suggested solution

The acylation takes place by the normal mechanism for the formation of amides from anhydrides, that is, by nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group and loss of the most stable anion (acetate) from the tetrahedral intermediate. The two isomers of alanine are enantiomers. Enantiomers must react at identical rates with an achiral reagent like acetic anhydride.

<!-- Media -->

In the enzyme-catalysed reaction, the acylase hydrolyses the amide group of one enantiome: while leaving the other unchanged. This time the two enantiomers do not react at the same rate because the reagent (or catalyst if you prefer) is chiral. Not surprisingly, the enzyme attacks the amide of natural alanine and leaves the unnatural enantiomer alone.

The purification and separation first requires removal of the enzyme. This is, of course, soluble in the aqueous buffer solution at \( \mathrm{{pH}}8 \) ,but acidification and heating denatures the protein (rather like heating egg white) and destroys its structure. The solid material filtered off is the denatured enzyme. The separation in ethanol works because the very polar amino acid is soluble only in water but the more 'organic' amide is soluble in ethanol. The amide has an extra organic group and only one very polar group \( \left( {{\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H}}\right) \) . In addition,it does not form a zwitterion.

Overheating in the acid solution causes cyclization of the amide oxygen atom on to the carboxylic acid. This reaction happens only because of the formation of a five-membered ring, an 'azlactone'. These compounds are particularly dreaded by amino acid chemists because they racemize easily by enolization and the enol is an aromatic compound.

## Suggested solution

There is remarkable regio- and stereochemical control in this sequence. How are the three \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) groups converted into three different functional groups with retention of configuration? The first step must be the formation of the trimesylate. Then treatment with base brings the pyrimidine into play and allows replacement of one mesylate by participation through a five-membered ring.

To complete the synthesis of the drug,some sort of elimination is needed,removing both \( \mathrm{{Br}} \) and OMs in a syn fashion.

## Problem 13

'Caustic soda' (NaOH) was used to clean ovens and clear blocked drains. Many commercial products for these jobs with fancy names still contain \( \mathrm{{NaOH}} \) . Even concentrated sodium carbonate \( \left( {{\mathrm{{Na}}}_{2}{\mathrm{{CO}}}_{3}}\right) \) does quite a good job. How do these cleaners work? Why is \( \mathrm{{NaOH}} \) so dangerous to humans, particularly if it gets in the eye?

## Purpose of the problem

Relating the structures and chemistry of fats to everyday things as well as everyday chemical reactions.

## Suggested solution

Fats are triesters of glycerol (triglycerides, pp. 1374-7). If the fatty acid is saturated (R in the diagram \( = n \) -alkyl),the fats are usually solids and can block drains. Hydrolysis with \( \mathrm{{NaOH}} \) and water,or even,less efficiently but more safely, \( {\mathrm{{Na}}}_{2}{\mathrm{{CO}}}_{3} \) and water gives liquid glycerol and solid but water-soluble sodium salts of the fatty acids.

Bacterial cell walls contain the unnatural amino acid D-alanine. If you wanted to prepare a sample of D-Ala, how would you go about it? (Hint. There is not enough in bacteria to make that a worthwhile source, but have you done Problem 8 yet?)

## Purpose of the problem

Combining biological chemistry with revision of asymmetric synthesis (Chapter 45).

## Suggested solution

As the chiral pool strategy is evidently no good, we are left with resolution or asymmetric synthesis. We could try one of the asymmetric catalytic reductions in Chapter 45, though the best of them works only for aromatic amino acids (p. 1236), or we could resolve. The method of Problem 8 - a kinetic resolution with an enzyme - certainly works and the unwanted L-amino acid can be racemized to get a greater yield. Resolution by chiral HPLC is effective with various commercially available columns. The answers to Problems 1 and 7 in Chapter 45 offer other suggestions. The synthesis of unnatural D-amino acids is now big business and inventing a good new method might pay dividends.

## Suggested solution

Base obviously removes the protons from both carboxylic acids but the reaction really starts with the removal of the proton from the hydroxyl group. This oxyanion promotes a deuterium (hydride if not labelled) shift to the ketone. The groups look a long way away but the diene ring adopts a boat conformation that brings them close together. Decarboxylation to give an aromatic ring follows.

## Purpose of the problem

Making sure you understand the way pyridoxal works (pp. 1384-8).

## Suggested solution

The full structures of pyridoxamine and pyridoxal are on p. 1384. The incorporation of ammon into \( \alpha \) -keto-glutarate and the formation of glutamic acid by NADPH reduction of the imine is p. 1386. The transamination from glutamic acid to pyridoxamine is on p. 1385. We start from-pyridoxamine, whose structure we abbreviate, and pyruvate. Imine formation (full mechanism ): pp. 348-50) followed by proton removal and replacement gives a new imine whose hydrolysis (f… mechanism on pp. 350-1) gives alanine and pyridoxal. The alanine is a single enantiomer because enzyme-directed protonation occurs on one face of the imine. Pyridoxal is recycled by transamination with glutamic acid.

## Suggested solution

The full structures of thiamine and of Stetter's catalyst appear in the chapter (pp. 1392-7). We use an abbreviated structure for the mechanism of conjugate addition. The essential features of this catalyst are that it is biomimetic and a \( {\mathrm{d}}^{1} \) reagent that does conjugate additions. The first stages are the formation of the ylid, direct attack on the most reactive carbonyl group, the ketone of the \( \alpha \) -keto-acid,and loss of \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2} \) to give the key intermediate.

This intermediate is an enol but it is also an enamine and a vinyl sulfide. Nitrogen and sulfur together are more electron-donating than \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) by itself so it does the conjugate addition from the 'wrong' end of the enol. Proton transfer and reversal of the first addition give the product and the catalyst ready for another cycle. The sequence is not only biomimetic in using a thiamine mimic. It also uses Nature's familiar trick: decarboxylation rather than removal of a proton from carbon.

<!-- Media -->

Anchoring the key reaction of the shikimic acid pathway with chemistry from Chapter 36.

## Suggested solution

The 'reaction in the shikimic acid pathway' is, of course, the [3,3]-sigmatropic shift in which chorismic acid rearranges to prephenic acid on the way to aromatic rings (p. 1403). The simpler reaction given here is one of the family of reactions from Chapter 36 (pp. 944-6) using an allylic alcohol and an enol derivative of a carbonyl compound. In this case we have the enol ether of a ketone. We must combine these to make an allyl vinyl ether for rearrangement.

<!-- Media -->

The biomimicry is quite good in that the rearrangement takes place around a six-membered ring and a ketone is formed in the right place in the side chain. It would be better if a keto-acid were formed and if there were some stereochemistry elsewhere in the six-membered ring so that we could see that it is a suprafacial migration. There is also a second alkene in chorismic acid. However, this reaction gives us the reassurance that \( \left\lbrack  {3,3}\right\rbrack \) -sigmatropic rearrangements of the type involved in the shikimic acid pathway do indeed take place.

## Problem 6

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

Showing that biological mechanisms too can be explored by isotopic labelling and stereochemistry.

## Suggested solution

The reaction is stereospecifically anti. This would fit an E2 mechanism but such a reaction could not occur with hydroxide as a leaving group. The \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group would first have to be turned into a good leaving group by a reaction such as phosphorylation. A more likely mechanism would be an E1cB via the enol of the acid but that would not be stereospecific if it were a chemical reaction. When the molecule is bound to the enzyme it might not be able to rotate and an ElcB mechanism might be possible. Studying stereochemistry by isotopic labelling is a standard technique for exploring enzymatic mechanisms.

The epoxide opens to give mainly a cation stabilized by the alkenes but not conjugated to the destabilizing ester group. The \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Et}} \) group then migrates.

<!-- Media -->

This is quite a good model reaction in that it shows that monoepoxides of benzenes can undergo a rearrangement quite like the NIH shift (pp. 1407-10) but in the real thing a hydrogen atom migrates with its electrons rather than the very different \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Et}} \) group. However,it is very difficult to make epoxides of aromatic rings without some substituent other than hydrogen and this is one limitation of model studies.

## Problem 8

The following experiments relate to the chemical and biological behaviour of NADH. Explain what they tell us.

<!-- Media -->

Reaction (b) was intended to model a simpler reduction by NADH. In the laboratory it is very difficult to find any simple carbonyl compounds that are reduced by NADH in the absence of the enzyme. Evidently, the mild general acid catalysis at the carbonyl group is needed for the reaction to occur. This model works because (1) the iminium salt is more reactive than a simple aldehyde and (2) the product contains two benzene rings.

- The reduction of \( N \) - methylacridinium is considerably more rapid than other nonenzymic transhydrogenation reactions.' (D. S. Sigman and group, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1973, 95, 6855)

## Purpose of the problem

Exploration of the mechanism of coenzyme reduction by model reactions using deuterium labelling and structural variation. Both these reactions were carried out in aqueous \( \left( {{\mathrm{D}}_{2}\mathrm{O}}\right. \) in the first case) buffer solutions without enzyme.

## Suggested solution

The full structure of NADH is on p. 1382 and that of FAD on p. 1407. We shall use abbreviated structures. The FAD analogue in part (a) of the question is very close to the real thing. In the reduction two atoms of hydrogen are added, one from NADH and one from the solution. The labelling experiment tells us which is which: hydride is transferred from NADH to the carbon atom of the FAD analogue and the nitrogen atom takes a proton from the solution. The same mechanism probably occurs in the real thing.

The chemistry of lipoic acid is described in the chapter (pp. 1394-5). A thiol ester of exactly the kind described in the problem is indeed involved and it is deacylated, though by CoASH rather than an alcohol, and the dithiol is indeed recycled as the disulfide. The oxidation to the cyclic disulfide is carried out in Nature by FAD. In the chapter we suggest that the oxidation of the dithiol to the disulfide is a separate step from the transesterification. You may well think that the evidence in this problem suggests that the oxidation may take place first.

## Purpose of the problem

Revision of chirality without a chiral centre from Chapter 16 (pp. 398-9) and further exploration of pyridoxal reactions.

## Suggested solution

Though the molecule is drawn in a planar fashion, with the sulfur-containing side chain lying in the plane of the pyridine ring, such a conformation is not possible as the chain is too short. In fact, the chain must twist across the top or bottom faces of the pyridine ring and cannot cross to the other side because the marked substituents - including the hydrogen atom - get in the way. It is not known which enantiomer has the (-) rotation.

The molecule is a chiral analogue of pyridoxamine and transamination occurs chemically by a mechanism similar to the biological one described in the chapter (pp. 1384-6). The zinc holds the molecule in a fixed conformation during reaction. The key step is the protonation of the enamine as that produces the new chiral centre. If the chain is across the top of the ring, protonation occurs preferentially from underneath. Hydrolysis gives the new amino acid (Phe) and the pyridoxal analogue, which can be recycled by reductive amination via the oxime.

You may feel that the chain is too far away from the site of protonation to have much effect and you'd be right. The best they could do was about 25% ee. In the biological system, the enzyme holds the molecule in a fixed conformation and delivers the proton from one face.

## Problem 11

Enzymes such as aldolase, thought to operate by the formation of an imine and/or an enamine with a lysine in the enzyme,can be studied by adding \( {\mathrm{{NaBH}}}_{4} \) to a mixture of enzyme and substrate. For example, treatment of the enzyme with the aldehyde shown below and \( {\mathrm{{NaBH}}}_{4} \) gives a permanently inhibited enzyme that on hydrolysis reveals a modified amino acid in place of one of the lysines. What is the structure of the modified amino acid, and why is this particular aldehyde chosen?

## Purpose of the problem

Exploration of a method of finding the active site of an enzyme by irreversible inhibition.

## Suggested solution

---

- This was part of a programme of investigations into enzyme mechanisms by F. H. Westheimer and group, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1971, 93, 7266, 7270. They called the \( p \) -nitrophenol a ’reporter group’.

---

The reaction used to inhibit the enzyme is our old friend, reductive amination. The amino group on the lysine is the most nucleophilic in the enzyme because it is involved in the active site and it forms an imine with the aldehyde. Reduction fixes the aldehyde to the enzyme as a secondary amine. Hydrolysis of the protein reveals a new amino acid in place of that lysine. This particular aldehyde was used because it contains a UV-active (actually coloured) \( p \) -nitrophenol so that the modified amino acid can be found among the many natural amino acids.

## Problem 12

This question is about the hydrolysis of esters by 'serine' enzymes. First, interpret these results: The hydrolysis of this ester is very much faster than that of ethyl benzoate itself. It is catalysed by imidazole and then there is a primary isotope effect (Chapter 41) \( {k}_{\left( \mathrm{{OH}}\right) }/{k}_{\left( \mathrm{{OD}}\right) } = {3.5} \) . What is the mechanism? What is the role of the histidine?

## Purpose of the problem

Exploration of a method of finding the active site of an enzyme by kinetics and by model studies. Revision of chapter 41.

## Suggested solution

The normal primary deuterium isotope effect in the first part shows that an \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) bond is being broken in the rate-determining step. Imidazole is too weak a base to remove the \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) proton completely so its role must be as general base catalyst. Attack on the carbonyl is the slow step with faster breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate and hydrolysis of the lactone. Lactones are hydrolysed faster than esters because they lack anomeric stabilization (p. 1134). The role of the OH group is intramolecular nucleophilic catalyst.

In outline,the mechanism of the enzyme catalysed hydrolysis must use the serine \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) as a nucleophilic catalyst to form the known intermediate and then hydrolyse that intermediate with water.

- The 'proton relay' involvement of the carboxylate group was discovered by P. Haake and co-workers, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1971, 93, 4938.

This mechanism is still not complete as we need extra acid or basic groups to put protons on to the tetrahedral intermediates as they form. From the requirement for the carboxylate anion, it looks as though the removal of the other proton from the imidazole of histidine helps. The complete mechanism is very complicated to draw and we shall draw just the rate-determining step of the chemical mechanism to show the main features.

The reactions are likely to resemble those of \( {\mathrm{{FADH}}}_{2} \) with oxygen and benzene oxide formation (p. 1408). Don't forget that ordinary oxygen is a triplet (diradical) good at abstracting hydrogen atoms. The intermediate radical is tertiary and is stabilized by the carbonyl group, a nitrogen atom, and imine conjugation so it is long-lived enough to combine with a hydroperoxide radical.

## Purpose of the problem

Reminder of electron counting in organometallic compounds. Minor exploration of porphyrins.

## Suggested solution

The iron porphyrin in the chapter (p. 1406) is an Fe(II) complex with 6 electrons from the iron and two each from the Fe-N bonds (see tables on pp. 1312-14). This makes 14 electrons in all so coordination to two more ligands would give the very favourable 18 electrons required for a stable complex. If you consider it to be an \( \mathrm{{Fe}}\left( 0\right) \) complex,you count 8 for the metal,one each from the two ’real’ Fe-N bonds, and two each from the other two nitrogen atoms giving the same number. If you merely 'consider' it to be an Fe(III) complex you again get the same answer, but if you actually remove an electron, making it an Fe(III) cation, then there really is one electron fewer. Only one ligand makes a sixteen-electron complex able to react with oxygen.

The zinc porphyrin is a Zn(II) species (two ’real’ Zn-N bonds and two dotted bonds) so it has 10 electrons. If we add eight for the four nitrogen ligands, we get 18 electrons. These compounds are stable and several substituted versions are sold by chemical companies. They will accept one extra ligand, for example, a pyridine, but this then pulls the zinc atom out of the plane of the porphyrin.

They are also an insect pheromone (grandisol) and defence substance (polyzonimine), stephanine is an aporphine alkaloid, scytalone a fungal metabolite, and diosgenin is a rare vegetable saponin from Dioscorea, the Mexican yam. It is useful as animal steroids can be made from it (p. 999).

---

Grandisol and polyzonimine have ten carbon atoms each with branched chains having methyl groups at the branchpoints. They are terpenes, specifically, monoterpenes. You might also have said that polyzonimine is an alkaloid as it is a basic nitrogen compound. Stephanine is definitely an alkaloid and belongs to the benzyl isoquinoline class. Serotonin is an amino acid metabolite derived from tryptophan. Scytalone has the characteristic unbranched chain and alternating oxygen substitution of a polyketide, an aromatic pentaketide in fact. Finally, diosgenine is steroid-like or, if you prefer, a triterpene metabolite.

The most obvious derivative of nicotinic acid that is nucleophilic in the 3-position would be an enamine, easily made by reduction. Let us try that first with the cyclic iminium salt to see if we can get anabasine.

That worked rather well! Though reduction is needed to get the enamine, the final product must - The same reduction of pyridinium be oxidized back to a pyridine again so there is no overall oxidation or reduction.

## Suggested solution

This is not as obvious as it seems. At first, the simplest thing to do is to restore the carbonyl groups from the benzene ring and break the central bond so that we see the fifth carbonyl group clearly (margin). We might then consider that the remaining \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group must have been formed by reduction of a carbonyl group and that the ring must have been closed by some sort of Claisen ester condensation. We can put the \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}\mathrm{H} \) group at any of the five sites so that gives us five possibilities.

## Purpose of the problem

Practice at recognizing the patterns of phenol coupling and what they mean.

## Suggested solution

Stephanine looks like an ortho/meta coupling but we know it can't be - it must result from a rearrangement step. If you follow the obvious pathway, you should find something like what we have drawn. You may have done the migration before the reduction, and that's fine. It is actually thought to be a dienol-benzene rearrangement rather than a dienone-phenol. You may also be worried by our redrawing the spiro compound. This is just to make the migration easier to see and the two rings are at right angles to each other so you can draw them either way.

Problem 8

Suggest a biosynthesis of olivetol.

## Purpose of the problem

Practice at recognizing the patterns of polyketides and the need for reduction and decarboxylation.

## Suggested solution

Olivetol has the characteristic \( 1,3 - \mathrm{{di}}\mathrm{{OH}} \) pattern of a polyketide around the benzene ring but it has only 11 carbon atoms so \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2} \) was probably lost somewhere and the long side chain has certainly been reduced. The acyl-polymalonate pathway (pp. 1425-36) needs to be used. We start from acetate and follow the sequence on pp. 1426-7 to get saturated butyroyl-SCoA. Then one acylation with reduction and further acylations without reduction take us to a compound that can be decarboxylated and cyclized to olivetol. The decarboxylation and cyclization might be concerted or either might occur before the other.

## Purpose of the problem

Your chance to speculate freely on the biosynthesis of a natural product from 'mixed metabolism'.

## Suggested solution

The structure of olivetol is given in the last problem and it is immediately obvious which parts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) come from which starting material. The only question is: how do they join up? There is also the question of the geometry of the alkene. It is \( E \) in geranyl pyrophosphate and that cannot cyclize. However, we know at least one way (p. 1440) - allylic rearrangement - of solving that problem.

There are many possible approaches all involving \( O \) -alkylation at one end, \( C \) -alkylation at the other, and cyclization. Here is one scheme; you may have thought of others as good. The first step is electrophilic aromatic substitution (Chapter 22) on a reactive benzene ring (two \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) groups) with a reactive allylic pyrophosphate.

<!-- Media -->

Next, some sort of allylic oxidation at the position between the alkene and the benzene ring. This would be with some oxygenation reagent such as FAD peroxide. The position is very reactive and would easily form radicals (Chapter 39).

<!-- Media -->

Now the stage is set for the allylic rearrangement, presumably of the pyrophosphate, and cyclization either in two steps or in the style of the polyolefin cyclizations in the chapter (pp. 1444-7). In either case we should expect a trans ring junction to be preferred.

The experiments you would want to do would include studying the incorporation of labelled (even doubly labelled) geranyl pyrophosphate and olivetol, synthesizing some of your proposed intermediates in labelled form, and seeing if they were incorporated into THC in the plant. However, attempts at these experiments have not been very successful because of poor incorporation of labelled compounds into the plant.

## Purpose of the problem

Some serious terpene biosynthesis for you to unravel.

## Suggested solution

These closely related compounds are clearly sesquiterpenes from the number of carbon atoms (15) and the pattern of their methyl groups.

## Purpose of the problem

An exercise in terpene synthesis by polyolefin cyclization.

## Suggested solution

The initial cyclization must occur by protonation of the terminal alkene. It is easier to see what happens if we move immediately to conformational drawings and write ’ \( R \) ’ for the side chain that does nothing in this first cyclization. The stereochemistry of the \( \mathrm{A}/\mathrm{B} \) ring junction is stereospecifically produced from the \( E \) geometry of the alkene and that of the \( \mathrm{B}/\mathrm{C} \) ring junction from the chair-like folding of the chain.

Conformational drawings reveal that the product has the larger group equatorial but it is not so easy this time to draw good conformations for the cyclization itself.

Finally, a migrationelimination sequence starting with protonation of the vinyl group leads to abietic acid itself. The methyl migration and proton loss in this step and the two previous cyclizations are, in their own small way, quite like the sequence of reactions in steroid biosynthesis (pp. 1445-7) except that the sequences are initiated by protonation rather than epoxidation and they are a series of small steps rather than one majestic sequence.

## Purpose of the problem

Some model reactions based on monoterpene biosynthesis.

## Suggested solution

Protonation of \( \alpha \) -pinene,migration of the bridge,and attack by chloride give bornyl chloride. Or do they? Two questions must be answered. Why does that bridge \( \left( {\mathrm{{CMe}}}_{2}\right) \) migrate and not the other \( \left( {\mathrm{{CH}}}_{2}\right) \) and why is only one diastereoisomer of the chloride formed? It is reasonable for the more highly substituted carbon atom to migrate (pp. 993-7). However we know that the resulting cation, if formed, would give the other diastereoisomer of the chloride (frame) so chloride addition must be concerted with migration and anti to the migrating group.

The second reaction involves formation of the cation (the one that is not an intermediate in the first reaction), migration, and elimination.

## Purpose of the problem

To show that the complicated but important formation of squalene has less important but more easily understood analogies.

## Suggested solution

The details of squalene biosynthesis are on pp. 1442-4. The biosynthesis of chrysanthemic acid requires only the first few steps of this sequence. The greatest simplification is that ’ \( R \) ’ in the squalene biosynthesis is now just a methyl group. The stereochemistry in the three-membered ring comes from the stereoselectivity of the enzyme-controlled ring closure reaction. Hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate and oxidation of the alcohol are needed to get the acid.

- This reaction was briefly discussed on p. 983 but its stereoselectivity was not then revealed.

The other two natural products seem to have the wrong skeleton for monoterpenes and that might have given you the clue that they are derived from the three-membered ring before it has lost the pyrophosphate group. This chemistry resembles a simpler version of the chemistry of presqualene pyrophosphate (pp. 1443-4). The intermediate allyl cation can add water from either end.

## Problem 14

In the chapter we suggested that you could detect an acetate starter unit and seven malonate additional units in the skeleton of brefeldin. Give the mechanism of the addition of the first malonyl CoA unit to acetate. Draw out the structure of the complete acyl polymalonate chain and state clearly what must happen to each section of it (reduction, elimination, etc.) to get brefeldin A.

## Purpose of the problem

Reminding you of the different and varied possible fates of each malonate unit added to the polyketide chain.

## Suggested solution

The details of the polyketide pathway are on pp. 1425-30. The first addition is a decarboxylation of the malonate and a nucleophilic substitution on acetyl CoA in one step (in frame). After the addition of each unit, reduction to an alcohol (stereoselective), elimination to the unsaturated acid, and reduction to the saturated acid may occur.

We can be definite about the fates of some of the units of brefeldin, as the diagram shows. The - Notice that the alkene, if there is units forming the five-membered ring are less certain. If the ring is formed by oxidation, as in one, appears between the units, as in an aldol reaction. prostaglandin synthesis (pp. 1431-2), elimination is needed before oxidation.

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

Reminder of the weaknesses inherent in, and the reassurance possible from, biomimetic experiments.

## Suggested solution

The relatively weak leaving group (acetate) is lost from the allylic reagent with Lewis acid catalysis from \( {\mathrm{{LiClO}}}_{4} \) to give a stable allyl cation. This couples with the isopentenyl acetate in a way very similar to the natural process. However, what happens to the resulting cation is not well controlled. Loss of one of the three marked protons from the cation gives each of the three products. In the enzymatic reaction,proton loss would be concerted with \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{C} \) bond formation and a basic group, such as the imidazole of histidine or a carboxylate anion, would be at the right position to remove one of the protons selectively.

Revision of electrophilic aromatic substitution (Chapter 22) and formation of a difunctional spacer, first step in polymerization.

Phenol is a nucleophilic aromatic compound (p. 557) and reacts even with acetone in acidic solution. The second reaction with a tertiary benzylic alcohol, is a more conventional Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Phenol is ortho, para-directing and the para product is favoured in both cases for steric reasons.

## Purpose of the problem

Getting used to the ideas and terminology of polymerization.

## Suggested solution

The product is a cyclic oligomer or, more exactly, a hexamer and the diol intermediate a tetramer. The monomer is ethylene glycol (1,2-dihydroxyethane), though that is not actually used in the synthesis. Using chloroethanol in acid to start with allows dimer formation without danger of polymerization as only the protonated alcohol can be displaced by the alcohol as nucleophile.

<!-- Media -->

For the second reaction, basic conditions are used so that chloride can be displaced by the oxyanions. The leaving groups(Cl)are in one molecule and the nucleophiles in the other so that the first reaction must be intermolecular. Thereafter, cyclization is preferred to a second intermolecular reaction. The complexation of potassium in the reacting species helps the cyclization. Even so, the yield is only moderate.

## Suggested solution

Using the hint, we have the dimerization step and then we have a number of options to get to the cyclic trimer. As long as you use amines as nucleophiles and imines as electrophiles, the precise order of events doesn't matter very much. Cyclization to form a six-membered ring will beat addition of a fourth cyanamide molecule and thermodynamically the trimerization is very favourable as melamine is aromatic.

## Suggested solution

The most obvious thing would be to use the pyridine polymer from Problem 4 in this chapter and to react it with \( {\mathrm{{CrO}}}_{3} \) and \( \mathrm{{HCl}} \) ,the way to make normal PCC. Some of the pyridine rings in the polymer will react. You might object that the oxidizing agent, the Cr(VI)-containing anion, is not bound to the polymer, but it is. In solution, cations and anions float around independently of each other but on the polymer the two are held together by electrostatic attraction. There is no need of a :ovalent bond.

## 2- - pose of the problem

the difficult creative exercise in the synthesis of a functionalized polymer.

## Suggested solution

Since the required polymer is a functionalized polystyrene, the most sensible approach would be to co-polymerize styrene and some 3,4-dihydroxystyrene, perhaps protected as an acetal or a silyl derivative. A proportion of the benzene rings in the polystyrene would have the correct functionalization and the crown ether could be built on to them by passing a large excess of a suitable reagent, such as one of those we discussed in Problem 2 of this chapter or in the main text (p. 1456), deprotecting as required. A potassium salt would be used as a base in the final cyclization to take advantage of complexation by the crown ether. The various methods of polymerizing styrene (radical, anionic, etc.) are described in the chapter (pp. 1459-62).

Problem 10

What is a 'block co-polymer'? What polymer would be produced by this sequence of reactions? What special physical properties would it have? Purpose of the problem

Moving on to block co-polymerization as a development of the chemistry in the previous two problems.

## Suggested solution

The polymerization of ethylene oxide cannot be controlled if there is enough water. It can be controlled only by limiting the amount of water when good yields of reasonable polymer lengths are formed rapidly, each containing one molecule of water (p. 1457). Polymer A is polyethylene glycol.

Each terminal \( \mathrm{{OH}} \) group can react with an isocyanate to make a urethane at each end of the old polymer (A) with a free isocyanate on the extreme end of the new polymer, polymer B. Polymer B is sometimes called a 'pre polymer' since it is the next step that links these units together in the final polymer.

Now the diamine reacts with the free isocyanates by forming a urea at each end of the chain to link them together. It is possible to show only a small fragment of this massive polymer but that is enough to see the block of polyethylene glycol, the block of (one) diarylmethane, and the double urea linkage beyond. There is more detail of this sort of reaction in the chapter (p. 1458).

## Problem 11

Why does polymerization occur only at relatively low temperatures, often below 200 C? What occurs at higher temperatures? Formaldehyde polymerizes only below about \( {100}^{ \circ  }\mathrm{C} \) but ethylene still polymerizes up to about \( {500}\mathrm{C} \) . Why the difference?

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

Going back to the fundamentals of polymerization, particularly the thermodynamics.

## Suggested solution

Polymerization is favourable thermodynamically (if the conversion of many \( \pi \) bonds into \( \sigma \) bonds is sufficiently favourable to make up for the inevitable negative entropy of the reaction. Polymerization always involves many molecules giving one so the entropy is always large and negative. The vital equation is (p. 313)

\[ - {RT}\ln K = {\Delta H}\;{T\Delta S}\]

Thus there must be a compensating gain in \( {\Delta H} \) ,that is,in the stability of the bonds in the polymer compared with those in the monomer, to offset the loss of entropy. The relative contribution made by entropy increases as the temperature goes up so polymerization tends to be favoured at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures depolymerization tends to occur.

---

- Depolymerization doesn't always occur as the polymer may decompose in some other way.

---

Formaldehyde contains a very strong \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{O} \) double bond while polyformaldehyde has \( \mathrm{C}\mathrm{O} \) single bonds instead. The single bond is only slightly stronger than two double bonds (in other carbonyl compounds such as ketones, \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{O} \) is more than twice as strong as \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{O} \) ). Low temperatures are needed for entropy not to play too big a part in the thermodynamics. Ethylene (ethene), on the other hand,has a weak \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{C} \) double bond while the polymer has \( \mathrm{C} - \mathrm{C} \) single bonds. These are much stronger than half a \( \mathrm{C} = \mathrm{C} \) so the gain in enthalpy during polymerization compensates for the loss of entropy at much higher temperatures.

## Problem 12

Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is used for rigid structures like window frames and gutters with only small amounts of additives such as pigments. If PVC is used for flexible things like plastic bags, about 20-30% of dialkyl phthalates such as the compound below are incorporated during polymerization. Why is this?

<!-- Media -->

<!-- figureText: dialkyl phthalate -->

`CCCCC(CC)COC(=O)C1=C(C=CC=C1)C(=O)OCC(CC)CCCC`

<!-- Media -->

## Purpose of the problem

One small problem on the composition of plastics rather than just polymers.

## Suggested solution

PVC is a regular polymer with chains that fit together well to form a rigid solid ideal for window frames and gutters but it is inevitably unable to bend far without breaking. Dialkyl phthalates are plasticizers that fit around the rigid chains rather in the way that a solvent fits round solute molecules. The difference here is that the polymer molecules are larger than the 'solvent'. You could also think of the plasticizer as a lubricant to allow the polymer chains to move across each other to make the whole structure flexible. Plasticizers are used in substantial quantities (20-30% suggested in the question). In fact, dialkyl phthalates are made for the plastics industry in amounts greater than those for almost any polymer.
